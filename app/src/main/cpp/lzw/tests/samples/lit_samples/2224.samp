nearer to it, and saw something standing on the path where it was not quite so
dark. It looked like a horse, and yet not quite like one, and on it was something
queer, not like a man. He heard it snorting. 'What can it be?' Zhílin gave a low
whistle, and off it dashed from the path into the thicket, and the woods were
filled with the noise of crackling, as if a hurricane were sweeping through,
breaking the branches.
Kostílin was so frightened that he sank to the ground. But Zhílin laughed
and said: 'It's a stag. Don't you hear him breaking the branches with his antlers?
We were afraid of him, and he is afraid of us.'
They went on. The Great Bear was already setting. It was near morning,
and they did not know whether they were going the right way or not. Zhílin
thought it was the way he had been brought by the Tartars, and that they were
still some seven miles from the Russian fort; but he had nothing certain to go by,
and at night one easily mistakes the way. After a time they came to a clearing.
Kostílin sat down and said: 'Do as you like, I can go no farther! My feet won't
carry me.'
Zhílin tried to persuade him.
'No I shall never get there, I can't!'
Zhílin grew angry, and spoke roughly to him.

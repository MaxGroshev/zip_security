Aksyónof wondered why he was asked all these questions, but he
described all that had happened, and then added, 'Why do you cross-question
me as if I were a thief or a robber? I am travelling on business of my own, and
there is no need to question me.'
Then the official, calling the soldiers, said, 'I am the police-officer of this
district, and I question you because the merchant with whom you spent last
night has been found with his throat cut. We must search your things.'
They entered the house. The soldiers and the police-officer unstrapped
Aksyónof's luggage and searched it. Suddenly the officer drew a knife out of a
bag, crying, 'Whose knife is this?'
Aksyónof looked, and seeing a blood-stained knife taken from his bag, he
was frightened.
'How is it there is blood on this knife?'
Aksyónof tried to answer, but could hardly utter a word, and only
stammered: 'I -- I don't know -- not mine.'

Lukáshka became confused.

“But what d’you mean by it? As if a horse were of little value,” he said without looking at the horse.

“Take it, take it! If you don’t you will offend me. Vanyúsha! Take the grey horse to his house.”

Lukáshka took hold of the halter.

“Well then, thank you! This is something unexpected, undreamt of.”

Olénin was as happy as a boy of twelve.

“Tie it up here. It’s a good horse. I bought it in Gróznoe; it gallops splendidly! Vanyúsha, bring us some chikhir. Come into the hut.”

The wine was brought. Lukáshka sat down and took the wine-bowl.

“God willing I’ll find a way to repay you,” he said, finishing his wine. “How are you called?”

“Dmítri Andréich.”

The colts were tethered behind the tents, and the mares were driven to them
twice a day. The mares were milked, and from the milk kumiss was made. It was
the women who prepared kumiss, and they also made cheese. As far as the men
were concerned, drinking kumiss and tea, eating mutton, and playing on their
pipes, was all they cared about. They were all stout and merry, and all the
summer long they never thought of doing any work. They were quite ignorant,
and knew no Russian, but were good-natured enough.
As soon as they saw Pahóm, they came out of their tents and gathered
round their visitor. An interpreter was found, and Pahóm told them he had come
about some land. The Bashkírs seemed very glad they took Pahóm and led him
into one of the best tents, where they made him sit on some down cushions
placed on a carpet, while they sat round him. They gave him tea and kumiss, and
had a sheep killed, and gave him mutton to eat. Pahóm took presents out of his
cart and distributed them among the Bashkírs, and divided amongst them the
tea. The Bashkírs were delighted. They talked a great deal among themselves,
and then told the interpreter to translate.
'They wish to tell you,' said the interpreter, 'that they like you, and that it
is our custom to do all we can to please a guest and to repay him for his gifts.
You have given us presents, now tell us which of the things we possess please
you best, that we may present them to you.'

A chair was placed at the prow for the Bishop, and he sat there, looking ahead.
The passengers all collected at the prow, and gazed at the island. Those who had
the sharpest eyes could presently make out the rocks on it, and then a mud hut
was seen. At last one man saw the hermits themselves. The captain brought a
telescope and, after looking through it, handed it to the Bishop.
'It's right enough. There are three men standing on the shore. There, a little
to the right of that big rock.'
The Bishop took the telescope, got it into position, and he saw the three
men: a tall one, a shorter one, and one very small and bent, standing on the shore
and holding each other by the hand.
The captain turned to the Bishop.
'The vessel can get no nearer in than this, your Grace. If you wish to go
ashore, we must ask you to go in the boat, while we anchor here.'
The cable was quickly let out, the anchor cast, and the sails furled. There
was a jerk, and the vessel shook. Then a boat having been lowered, the oarsmen
jumped in, and the Bishop descended the ladder and took his seat. The men
pulled at their oars, and the boat moved rapidly towards the island. When they
came within a stone's throw they saw three old men: a tall one with only a mat
tied round his waist: a shorter one in a tattered peasant coat, and a very old one
bent with age and wearing an old cassock -- all three standing hand in hand.

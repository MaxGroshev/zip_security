“Here, have a drink, Maryánka dear!” said the old woman, passing the jug to the girl. “God willing we’ll have enough to pay for the wedding feast,” she added.

“That’s not yet awhile,” said the cornet with a slight frown.

The girl hung her head.

“Why shouldn’t we mention it?” said the old woman. “The affair is settled, and the time is drawing near too.”

“Don’t make plans beforehand,” said the cornet. “Now we have the harvest to get in.”

“Have you seen Lukáshka’s new horse?” asked the old woman. “That which Dmítri Andréich Olénin gave him is gone — he’s exchanged it.”

“No, I have not; but I spoke with the servant today,” said the cornet, “and he said his master has again received a thousand rubles.”

“Rolling in riches, in short,” said the old woman.

The whole family felt cheerful and contented.

The work was progressing successfully. The grapes were more abundant and finer than they had expected. After dinner Maryánka threw some grass to the oxen, folded her beshmet for a pillow, and lay down under the wagon on the juicy down-trodden grass. She had on only a red kerchief over her head and a faded blue print smock, yet she felt unbearably hot. Her face was burning, and she did not know where to put her feet, her eyes were moist with sleepiness and weariness, her lips parted involuntarily, and her chest heaved heavily and deeply.

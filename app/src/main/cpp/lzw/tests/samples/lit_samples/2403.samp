There was no help for it. The old Devil had to begin making the round.
In due course the turn came for him to go to Ivan's house. The old Devil
came in to dinner, and the dumb girl was getting it ready.
She had often been deceived by lazy folk who came early to dinner --
without having done their share of work -- and ate up all the porridge, so it had
occurred to her to find out the sluggards by their hands. Those who had horny
hands, she put at the table, but the others got only the scraps that were left over.
The old Devil sat down at the table, but the dumb girl seized him by the
hands and looked at them -- there were no hard places there: the hands were
clean and smooth, with long nails. The dumb girl gave a grunt and pulled the
Devil away from the table. And Iván's wife said to him, 'Don't be offended, fine
gentleman. My sister-in-law does not allow any one to come to table who hasn't
horny hands. But wait awhile, after the folk have eaten you shall have what is
left.'
The old Devil was offended that in the King's house they wished him to
feed like a pig. He said to Iván, 'It is a foolish law you have in your kingdom that
every one must work with his hands. It's your stupidity that invented it. Do
people work only with their hands? What do you think wise men work with?'
And Iván said, 'How are we fools to know? We do most of our work with
our hands and our backs.'

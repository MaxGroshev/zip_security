epigrams, the snap of his  final couplets. None of these effects can  emerge
from  a  purely  literal  unrhymed  translation.  In  fact,  to  offset  the
inevitable  loss in verbal  exactness,  a  rhyming  version  can  aim  at  a
different sort of accuracy, an equivalence or parallelism conveying, however
faintly, the impact of the original.
     Apart from the overall  difficulty of  his  task, the  translator  with
ambitions of this  type will find  that Pushkin's work presents him with two
particular problems.
     The brio of the Russian text partly depends on a lavish use not only of
French and other foreign words, but of  slang and of  audacious Byronic-type
rhymes.  If  the  translator produces nothing comparable, he is emasculating
his original. If he attempts to follow suit, he must  do all he can to avoid
the pitfalls of the embarrassing, the facetious and the arch. {29}
     Secondly, he must be on his guard against the ludicrous effect that the
feminine  ending (for instance the pleasure/measure rhyme, which is so  much
derided by Nabokov) can all too easily produce in English. He must not sing,
like Prince Gremin in one English version of Chaykovsky's opera:

        ``I wouldn't be remotely human
        Did I not love the Little Woman.''

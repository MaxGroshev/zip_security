funeral feast.
For three days they went on eating the flesh of the mare, drinking buza,
and praying for the dead man. All the Tartars were at home. On the fourth day at
dinner-time Zhílin saw them preparing to go away. Horses were brought out,
they got ready, and some ten of them (the red one among them) rode away; but
Abdul stayed at home. It was new moon, and the nights were still dark.

'Ah!' thought Zhílin, 'to-night is the time to escape.' And he told Kostílin;
but Kostílin's heart failed him.
'How can we escape?' he said. 'We don't even know the way.'
'I know the way,' said Zhílin.
'Even if you do'' said Kostílin, 'we can't reach the fort in one night.'
'If we can't,' said Zhílin, 'we'll sleep in the forest. See here, I have saved
some cheeses. What's the good of sitting and moping here? If they send your
ransom -- well and good; but suppose they don't manage to collect it? The
Tartars are angry now, because the Russians have killed one of their men. They
are talking of killing us.'
Kostílin thought it over.
'Well, let's go,' said he.

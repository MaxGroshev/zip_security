Natásha stopped him.

“Count, is it wrong of me to sing?” she said blushing, and fixing her eyes inquiringly on him.

“No... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?”

“I don’t know myself,” Natásha answered quickly, “but I should not like to do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely. You don’t know how important you are to me, how much you’ve done for me....” She spoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her words. “I saw in that same army order that he, Bolkónski” (she whispered the name hastily), “is in Russia, and in the army again. What do you think?”—she was speaking hurriedly, evidently afraid her strength might fail her—“Will he ever forgive me? Will he not always have a bitter feeling toward me? What do you think? What do you think?”

“I think...” Pierre replied, “that he has nothing to forgive.... If I were in his place...”

By association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the day when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not himself but the best man in the world and free, he would ask on his knees for her hand; and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took possession of him and the same words rose to his lips. But she did not give him time to say them.

“Yes, you... you...” she said, uttering the word you rapturously—“that’s a different thing. I know no one kinder, more generous, or better than you; nobody could be! Had you not been there then, and now too, I don’t know what would have become of me, because...”

Tears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music before her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and down the room.

Just then Pétya came running in from the drawing room.

Pétya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and resembled Natásha. He was preparing to enter the university, but he and his friend Obolénski had lately, in secret, agreed to join the hussars.

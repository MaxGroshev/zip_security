“Every one...” and Luke swayed his head.

“Is it true you are getting married?” asked Olénin.

“Mother wants me to marry. But I have not got a horse yet.”

“Aren’t you in the regular service?”

“Oh dear no! I’ve only just joined, and have not got a horse yet, and don’t know how to get one. That’s why the marriage does not come off.”

“And what would a horse cost?”

“We were bargaining for one beyond the river the other day and they would not take sixty rubles for it, though it is a Nogáy horse.”

“Will you come and be my drabánt?” (A drabánt was a kind of orderly attached to an officer when campaigning.) “I’ll get it arranged and will give you a horse,” said Olénin suddenly. “Really now, I have two and I don’t want both.”

“How—don’t want it?” Lukáshka said, laughing. “Why should you make me a present? We’ll get on by ourselves by God’s help.”

“No, really! Or don’t you want to be a drabánt?” said Olénin, glad that it had entered his head to give a horse to Lukáshka, though, without knowing why, he felt uncomfortable and confused and did not know what to say when he tried to speak.

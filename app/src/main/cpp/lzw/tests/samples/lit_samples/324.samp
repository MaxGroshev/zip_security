“Yes, she’ll be there. Do come!” said Belétski, without the least surprise. “But isn’t it a pretty picture?” he added, pointing to the motley crowds.

“Yes, very!” Olénin assented, trying to appear indifferent.

“Holidays of this kind,” he added, “always make me wonder why all these people should suddenly be contented and jolly. Today for instance, just because it happens to be the fifteenth of the month, everything is festive. Eyes and faces and voices and movements and garments, and the air and the sun, are all in a holiday mood. And we no longer have any holidays!”

“Yes,” said Belétski, who did not like such reflections.

“And why are you not drinking, old fellow?” he said, turning to Eróshka.

Eróshka winked at Olénin, pointing to Belétski. “Eh, he’s a proud one that kunak of yours,” he said.

Belétski raised his glass.

“Allah birdy!” he said, emptying it. (Allah birdy, “God has given!”—the usual greeting of Caucasians when drinking together.)

“Sau bul” (“Your health”), answered Eróshka smiling, and emptied his glass.

“Speaking of holidays!” he said, turning to Olénin as he rose and looked out of the window, “What sort of holiday is that! You should have seen them make merry in the old days! The women used to come out in their gold-trimmed sarafáns. Two rows of gold coins hanging round their necks and gold-cloth diadems on their heads, and when they passed they made a noise, ‘flu, flu,’ with their dresses. Every woman looked like a princess. Sometimes they’d come out, a whole herd of them, and begin singing songs so that the air seemed to rumble, and they went on making merry all night. And the Cossacks would roll out a barrel into the yards and sit down and drink till break of day, or they would go hand-in-hand sweeping the village. Whoever they met they seized and took along with them, and went from house to house. Sometimes they used to make merry for three days on end. Father used to come home—I still remember it—quite red and swollen, without a cap, having lost everything: he’d come and lie down. Mother knew what to do: she would bring him some fresh caviar and a little chikhir to sober him up, and would herself run about in the village looking for his cap. Then he’d sleep for two days! That’s the sort of fellows they were then! But now what are they?”

miles, they came to a large village and passed right through it. It had now grown
hot. Elisha was tired out and wanted to rest and have a drink, but Efím did not
stop. Efím was the better walker of the two, and Elisha found it hard to keep up
with him.
'If I could only have a drink,' said he.
'Well, have a drink,' said Efím. 'I don't want any.'
Elisha stopped.
'You go on,' he said, 'but I'll just run in to the little hut there. I will catch
you up in a moment.'
'All right,' said Efím, and he went on along the high road alone, while
Elisha turned back to the hut.
It was a small hut plastered with clay, the bottom a dark colour, the top
whitewashed; but the clay had crumbled away. Evidently it was long since it had
been re-plastered, and the thatch was off the roof on one side. The entrance to the
hut was through the yard. Elisha entered the yard, and saw, lying close to a bank
of earth that ran round the hut, a gaunt, beardless man with his shirt tucked into
his trousers, as is the custom in Little Russia13. The man must have lain down in
the shade, but the sun had come round and now shone full on him. Though not
asleep, he still lay there. Elisha called to him, and asked for a drink, but the man
gave no answer.

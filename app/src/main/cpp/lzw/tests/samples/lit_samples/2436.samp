drink to the guests, and as she handed it round she tumbled against the table and
spilt a glassful.
The peasant was angry, and scolded his wife: 'What do you mean, you
slut? Do you think it's ditchwater, you cripple, that you must go pouring good
stuff like that over the floor?'
The imp nudged the Devil, his master, with his elbow: 'See,' said he, 'that's
the man who did not grudge his last crust!'
The peasant, still railing at his wife, began to carry the drink round
himself. Just then a poor peasant returning from work came in uninvited. He
greeted the company, sat down, and saw that they were drinking. Tired with his
day's work he felt that he too would like a drop. He sat and sat, and his mouth
kept watering, but the host instead of offering him any only muttered: 'I can't
find drink for every one who comes along.'
This pleased the Devil; but the imp chuckled and said, 'Wait a bit, there's
more to come yet!'
The rich peasants drank, and their host drank too. And they began to
make false, oily speeches to one another.
The Devil listened and listened, and praised the imp.
'If,' said he, 'the drink makes them so foxy that they begin to cheat each
other, they will soon all be in our hands.'

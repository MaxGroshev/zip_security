told him to. The sheaf fell asunder, and all the straws changed into soldiers, with
a trumpeter and a drummer playing in front, so that there was a whole regiment.
Iván laughed.
'How clever!' said he. 'This is fine! How pleased the girls will be!'
'Now let me go,' said the imp.
'No,' said Iván, 'I must make my soldiers of thrashed straw, otherwise
good grain will be wasted. Teach me how to change them back again into the
sheaf. I want to thrash it.'
And the imp said, 'Repeat:
'Let each be a straw
Who was soldier before,
For my true slave
This order gave!"'
Iván said this, and the sheaf reappeared.
Again the imp began to beg, 'Now let me go!
'All right.' And Iván pressed him against the side of the cart, held him
down with his hand, and pulled him off the fork.
'God be with you,' said he.
And as soon as he mentioned God, the imp plunged into the earth like a
stone into water. Only a hole was left.

Mullah crying from the roof, 'Allah, Beshmillah! Ilrahman!' That meant that the
people would be going to the Mosque. So they sat down again, hiding behind a
wall, and waited a long time till the people had passed. At last all was quiet
again.
'Now then! May God be with us!' They crossed themselves, and started
once more. They passed through a yard and went down the hillside to the river,
crossed the river, and went along the valley.
The mist was thick, but only near the ground; overhead the stars shone
quite brightly. Zhílin directed their course by the stars. It was cool in the mist,
and easy walking, only their boots were uncomfortable, being worn out and
trodden down. Zhílin took his off, threw them away, and went barefoot, jumping

from stone to stone, and guiding his course by the stars. Kostílin began to lag
behind.
'Walk slower,' he said, 'these confounded boots have quite blistered my
feet.'
'Take them off!' said Zhílin. 'It will be easier walking without them.'
Kostílin went barefoot, but got on still worse. The stones cut his feet and
he kept lagging behind. Zhílin said: 'If your feet get cut, they'll heal again; but if
the Tartars catch us and kill us, it will be worse!'

“That wouldn’t be fair. He has been with me so many years. I can’t let him go just so, without any cause.”

“Supposing he has worked for you for years. He didn’t work for nothing. He got paid for it. He’s certainly saved up a few dollars for his old age.”

“Saved up! How could he? From what? He’s not alone in the world. He has a wife to support, and she has to eat and drink also.”

“His wife earns money, too, at day’s work as charwoman.”

“A lot she could have made! Enough for kvas.”

“Why should you care about Polikarpych and his wife? To tell you the truth, he’s a very poor servant. Why should you throw your money away on him? He never shovels the snow away on time, or does anything right. And when it comes his turn to be night watchman, he slips away at least ten times a night. It’s too cold for him. You’ll see, some day, because of him, you will have trouble with the police. The quarterly inspector will descend on us, and it won’t be so agreeable for you to be responsible for Polikarpych.”

“Still, it’s pretty rough. He’s been with me fifteen years. And to treat him that way in his old age—it would be a sin.”

“A sin! Why, what harm would you be doing him? He won’t starve. He’ll go to the almshouse. It will be better for him, too, to be quiet in his old age.”

Sharov reflected.

“All right,” he said finally. “Bring your friend here. I’ll see what I can do.”

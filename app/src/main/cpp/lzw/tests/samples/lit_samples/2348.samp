him that taketh away thy cloke withhold not thy coat also. Give to every man
that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. And
as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.'
He also read the verses where our Lord says:
'And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew
you to whom he is like: He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep,
and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat
vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a
rock. But he that heareth and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation
built an house upon the earth, against which the stream did beat vehemently,
and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.'
When Martin read these words his soul was glad within him. He took off
his spectacles and laid them on the book, and leaning his elbows on the table
pondered over what he had read. He tried his own life by the standard of those
words, asking himself:
'Is my house built on the rock, or on sand? If it stands on the rock, it is
well. It seems easy enough while one sits here alone, and one thinks one has
done all that God commands; but as soon as I cease to be on my guard, I sin
again. Still I will persevere. It brings such joy. Help me, O Lord!'

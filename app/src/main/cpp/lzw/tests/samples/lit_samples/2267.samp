never saw him smile, except that first evening when Matryóna gave them
supper.

Day by day and week by week the year went round. Michael lived and
worked with Simon. His fame spread till people said that no one sewed boots so
neatly and strongly as Simon's workman, Michael; and from all the district round
people came to Simon for their boots, and he began to be well off.
One winter day, as Simon and Michael sat working a carriage on sledgerunners, with three horses and with bells, drove up to the hut. They looked out of
the window; the carriage stopped at their door, a fine servant jumped down from
the box and opened the door. A gentleman in a fur coat got out and walked up to
Simon's hut. Up jumped Matryóna and opened the door wide. The gentleman
stooped to enter the hut, and when he drew himself up again his head nearly
reached the ceiling, and he seemed quite to fill his end of the room.
Simon rose, bowed, and looked at the gentleman with astonishment. He
had never seen any one like him. Simon himself was lean, Michael was thin, and
Matryóna was dry as a bone, but this man was like some one from another
world: red-faced, burly, with a neck like a bull's, and looking altogether as if he
were cast in iron.
The gentleman puffed, threw off his fur coat, sat down on the bench, and
said, 'Which of you is the master bootmaker?'

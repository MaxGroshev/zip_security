to rake it up, and went himself to mow the rye. He went with the scythe, but the
dock-tailed imp was there first, and entangled the rye so that the scythe was of
no use. But Iván went home and got his sickle, and began to reap with that and
he reaped the whole of the rye.
'Now it's time,' said he, 'to start on the oats.'
The dock-tailed imp heard this, and thought, 'I couldn't get the better of
him on the rye, but I shall on the oats. Only wait till the morning.'
In the morning the imp hurried to the oat field, but the oats were already
mowed down! Iván had mowed them by night, in order that less grain should
shake out. The imp grew angry.
'He has cut me all over and tired me out -- the fool. It is worse than war.
The accursed fool never sleeps; one can't keep up with him. I will get into his
stacks now and rot them.'
So the imp entered the rye, and crept among the sheaves, and they began
to rot. He heated them, grew warm himself, and fell asleep.
Iván harnessed the mare, and went with the lass to cart the rye. He came
to the heaps, and began to pitch the rye into the cart. He tossed two sheaves and
again thrust his fork -- right into the imp's back. He lifts the fork and sees on the
prongs a live imp; dock-tailed, struggling, wriggling, and trying to jump.
'What, you nasty thing, are you here again?'

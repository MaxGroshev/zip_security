frighten him away.'
Leaving the track, therefore, we turned off to the left. But when we had
gone about five hundred yards, there were the bear's traces again right before us.
We followed them, and they brought us out on to the road. There we stopped,
31
examining the road to see which way the bear had gone. Here and there in the
snow were prints of the bear's paw, claws and all, and here and there the marks
of a peasant's bark shoes. The bear had evidently gone towards the village.
As we followed the road, Damian said:
'It's no use watching the road now. We shall see where he has turned off,
to right or left, by the marks in the soft snow at the side. He must have turned off
somewhere; for he won't have gone on to the village.'
We went along the road for nearly a mile, and then saw, ahead of us, the
bear's track turning off the road. We examined it. How strange! It was a bear's
track right enough, only not going from the road into the forest, but from the
forest on to the road! The toes were pointing towards the road.
'This must be another bear,' I said.
Damian looked at it, and considered a while.
'No,' said he. 'It's the same one. He's been playing tricks, and walked
backwards when he left the road.'

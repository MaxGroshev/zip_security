to shame, accusing him of having been caught horse-stealing. Gabriel was tipsy,
and unable to contain his anger, gave the woman such a blow that she was laid
up for a week; and she was pregnant at the time. Iván was delighted. He went to
the magistrate to lodge a complaint. 'Now I'll get rid of my neighbour! He won't
escape imprisonment, or exile to Siberia.' But Ivan's wish was not fulfilled. The
magistrate dismissed the case. The woman was examined, but she was up and
about and showed no sign of any injury. Then Ivan went to the Justice of the
Peace, but he referred the business to the District Court. Ivan bestirred himself:
treated the clerk and the Elder of the District Court to a gallon of liquor and got
Gabriel condemned to be flogged. The sentence was read out to Gabriel by the
clerk: 'The Court decrees that the peasant Gabriel Gordéyef shall receive twenty
lashes with a birch rod at the District Court.'
Ivan too heard the sentence read, and looked at Gabriel to see how he
would take it. Gabriel grew as pale as a sheet, and turned round and went out
into the passage. Ivan followed him, meaning to see to the horse, and he
overheard Gabriel say, 'Very well! He will have my back flogged: that will make
it burn; but something of his may burn worse than that!'
Hearing these words, Ivan at once went back into the Court, and said:
'Upright judges! He threatens to set my house on fire! Listen: he said it in the
presence of witnesses!'

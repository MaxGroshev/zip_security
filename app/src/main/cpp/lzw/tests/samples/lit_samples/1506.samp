The countess, tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey, was pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting.

The countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing Sónya’s arm, glanced around.

“You say he is dying?”

Sónya nodded.

The countess put her arms around Sónya and began to cry.

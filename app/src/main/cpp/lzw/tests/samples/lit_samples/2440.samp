'Well, what of that?' replied the younger. 'Of course our work is rough and
coarse. But, on the other hand, it is sure; and we need not bow to any one. But
you, in your towns, are surrounded by temptations; to-day all may be right, but
to-morrow the Evil One may tempt your husband with cards, wine, or women,
and all will go to ruin. Don't such things happen often enough?'
Pahóm, the master of the house, was lying on the top of the oven, and he
listened to the women's chatter.
'It is perfectly true,' thought he. 'Busy as we are from childhood tilling
mother earth, we peasants have no time to let any nonsense settle in our heads.
Our only trouble is that we haven't land enough. If I had plenty of land, I
shouldn't fear the Devil himself!'
The women finished their tea, chatted a while about dress, and then
cleared away the tea-things and lay down to sleep.
But the Devil had been sitting behind the oven, and had heard all that was
said. He was pleased that the peasant's wife had led her husband into boasting,
and that he had said that if he had plenty of land he would not fear the Devil
himself.
'All right,' thought the Devil. 'We will have a tussle. I'll give you land
enough; and by means of that land I will get you into my power.'

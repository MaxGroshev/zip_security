village Elder, and when he left office his accounts were in good order. He had a
large family: two sons and a married grandson, all living with him. He was hale,
long-bearded and erect, and it was only when he was past sixty that a little grey
began to show itself in his beard.
Elisha was neither rich nor poor. He had formerly gone out carpentering,
but now that he was growing old he stayed at home and kept bees. One of his
sons had gone away to find work, the other was living at home. Elisha was a
kindly and cheerful old man. It is true he drank sometimes, and he took snuff,
and was fond of singing, but he was a peaceable man, and lived on good terms
with his family and with his neighbours. He was short and dark, with a curly
beard, and, like his patron saint Elisha, he was quite bald-headed.
The two old men had taken a vow long since and had arranged to go on a
pilgrimage to Jerusalem together: but Efím could never spare the time; he always
had so much business on hand; as soon as one thing was finished he started
another. First he had to arrange his grandson's marriage; then to wait for his
youngest son's return from the army, and after that he began building a new hut.
One holiday the two old men met outside the hut and, sitting down on
some timber, began to talk.
'Well,' asked Elisha, 'when are we to fulfil our vow?'
Efím made a wry face.

“Hurt, indeed! Don’t interrupt: I don’t like it. Let me finish. We boozed and boozed till morning, and I fell asleep on the top of the oven, drunk. When I woke in the morning I could not unbend myself anyhow—”

“Was it very painful?” repeated Olénin, thinking that now he would at last get an answer to his question.

“Did I tell you it was painful? I did not say it was painful, but I could not bend and could not walk.”

“And then it healed up?” said Olénin, not even laughing, so heavy was his heart.

“It healed up, but the bullet is still there. Just feel it!” And lifting his shirt he showed his powerful back, where just near the bone a bullet could be felt and rolled about.

“Feel how it rolls,” he said, evidently amusing himself with the bullet as with a toy. “There now, it has rolled to the back.”

“And Lukáshka, will he recover?” asked Olénin.

“Heaven only knows! There’s no doctor. They’ve gone for one.”

“Where will they get one? From Gróznoe?” asked Olénin.

“No, my lad. Were I the Tsar I’d have hung all your Russian doctors long ago. Cutting is all they know! There’s our Cossack Bakláshka, no longer a real man now that they’ve cut off his leg! That shows they’re fools. What’s Bakláshka good for now? No, my lad, in the mountains there are real doctors. There was my chum, Vórchik, he was on an expedition and was wounded just here in the chest. Well, your doctors gave him up, but one of theirs came from the mountains and cured him! They understand herbs, my lad!”

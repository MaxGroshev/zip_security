by a stout, bare-footed, tattered man, who also had his leg shackled.
Zhílin gasped with surprise: it was Kostílin. He, too, had been taken. They
were put side by side, and began to tell each other what had occurred. While
they talked, the Tartars looked on in silence. Zhílin related what had happened to
him; and Kostílin told how his horse had stopped, his gun missed fire, and this
same Abdul had overtaken and captured him.
Abdul jumped up, pointed to Kostílin, and said something. The
interpreter translated that they both now belonged to one master, and the one
who first paid the ransom would be set free first.
'There now,' he said to Zhílin, 'you get angry, but your comrade here is
gentle; he has written home, and they will send five thousand roubles. So he will
be well fed and well treated.'

Zhílin replied: 'My comrade can do as he likes; maybe he is rich, I am not.
It must be as I said. Kill me, if you like -- you will gain nothing by it; but I will
not write for more than five hundred roubles.'
They were silent. Suddenly up sprang Abdul, brought a little box, took out
a pen, ink, and a bit of paper, gave them to Zhílin, slapped him on the shoulder,
and made a sign that he should write. He had agreed to take five hundred
roubles.

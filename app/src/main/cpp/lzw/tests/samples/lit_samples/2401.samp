But nobody came to work and nothing was brought. Only sometimes a
boy or a little girl would run up to exchange an egg for a gold coin, but nobody
else came, and he had nothing to eat. And being hungry, the fine gentleman went
through the village to try and buy something for dinner. He tried at one house,
and offered a gold piece for a fowl, but the housewife wouldn't take it.
'I have a lot already,' said she.
He tried at a widow's house to buy a herring, and offered a gold piece.
'I don't want it, my good sir,' said she. 'I have no children to play with it,
and I myself already have three coins as curiosities.'
He tried at a peasant's house to get bread, but neither would the peasant
take money.
'I don't need it,' said he, 'but if you are begging "for Christ's sake15," wait a
bit and I'll tell the housewife to cut you a piece of bread.'
At that the Devil spat, and ran away. To hear Christ's name mentioned, let
alone receiving anything for Christ's sake, hurt him more than sticking a knife
into him.
And so he got no bread. Every one had gold, and no matter where the old
Devil went, nobody would give anything for money, but every one said, 'Either
bring something else, or come and work, or receive what you want in charity for
Christ's sake.'

We followed the track, and found it really was so! The bear had gone
some ten steps backwards, and then, behind a fir tree, had turned round and
gone straight ahead. Damian stopped and said:
'Now, we are sure to get round him. There is a marsh ahead of us, and he
must have settled down there. Let us go round it.'
We began to make our way round, through a fir thicket. I was tired out by
this time, and it had become still more difficult to get along. Now I glided on to
juniper bushes and caught my snow-shoes in them, now a tiny fir tree appeared
between my feet, or, from want of practise, my snow-shoes slipped off; and now
I came upon a stump or a log hidden by the snow. I was getting very tired, and
was drenched with perspiration; and I took off my fur cloak. And there was
Damian all the time, gliding along as if in a boat, his snowshoes moving as if of
their own accord, never catching against anything, nor slipping off. He even took
my fur and slung it over his shoulder, and still kept urging me on.
We went on for two more miles, and came out on the other side of the
marsh. I was lagging behind. My snow-shoes kept slipping off, and my feet
stumbled. Suddenly Damian, who was ahead of me, stopped and waved his arm.
When I came up to him, he bent down, pointing with his hand, and whispered:
'Do you see the magpie chattering above that undergrowth? It scents the
bear from afar. That is where he must be.'

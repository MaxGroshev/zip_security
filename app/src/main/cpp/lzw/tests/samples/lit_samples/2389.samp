from Iván, but increased it largely. He introduced law and order into his
kingdom. He kept his money in coffers, and taxed the people. He instituted a
poll-tax, tolls for walking and driving, and a tax on shoes and stockings and
dress trimmings. And whatever he wished for he got. For the sake of money,
people brought him everything, and they offered to work for him -- for every one
wanted money.
Iván the Fool, also, did not live badly. As soon as he had buried his fatherin-law, he took off all his royal robes and gave them to his wife to put away in a
chest; and he again donned his hempen shirt, his breeches and peasant shoes,
and started again to work.
'It's dull for me,' said he. 'I'm getting fat and have lost my appetite and my
sleep.' So he brought his father and mother and his dumb sister to live with him,
and worked as before.
People said, 'But you are a king!'
'Yes,' said he, 'but even a king must eat.'
One of his ministers came to him and said, 'We have no money to pay
salaries.'
'All right,' says he, 'then don't pay them.'
'Then no one will serve.'
'All right; let them not serve. They will have more time to work; let them
cart manure. There is plenty of scavenging to be done.'

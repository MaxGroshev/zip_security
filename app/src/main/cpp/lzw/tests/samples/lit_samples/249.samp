“And I’ve been told that they will dig a pit to put the girls in because they don’t love the lads,” said Nazárka, approaching Ústenka; and he again made a whimsical gesture which set everybody laughing, and Ergushóv, passing by Maryánka, who was next in turn, began to embrace an old woman.

“Why don’t you hug Maryánka? You should do it to each in turn,” said Nazárka.

“No, my old one is sweeter,” shouted the Cossack, kissing the struggling old woman.

“You’ll throttle me,” she screamed, laughing.

The tramp of regular footsteps at the other end of the street interrupted their laughter. Three soldiers in their cloaks, with their muskets on their shoulders, were marching in step to relieve guard by the ammunition wagon.

The corporal, an old cavalry man, looked angrily at the Cossacks and led his men straight along the road where Lukáshka and Nazárka were standing, so that they should have to get out of the way. Nazárka moved, but Lukáshka only screwed up his eyes and turned his broad back without moving from his place.

“People are standing here, so you go round,” he muttered, half turning his head and tossing it contemptuously in the direction of the soldiers.

The soldiers passed by in silence, keeping step regularly along the dusty road.

Maryánka began laughing and all the other girls chimed in.

“What swells!” said Nazárka, “Just like long-skirted choristers,” and he walked a few steps down the road imitating the soldiers.

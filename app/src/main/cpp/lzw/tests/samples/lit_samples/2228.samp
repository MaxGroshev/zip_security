two other Tartars following him. After talking with the strangers, he put Zhílin
and Kostílin on two of his own horses and took them back to the Aoul.
Abdul did not laugh now, and did not say a word to them.
They were back at the Aoul by daybreak, and were set down in the street.
The children came crowding round, throwing stones, shrieking, and beating
them with whips.
The Tartars gathered together in a circle, and the old man from the foot of
the hill was also there. They began discussing, and Zhílin heard them
considering what should be done with him and Kostílin. Some said they ought to
be sent farther into the mountains; but the old man said: 'They must be killed!'
Abdul disputed with him, saying: 'I gave money for them, and I must get
ransom for them.' But the old man said: 'They will pay you nothing, but will only
bring misfortune. It is a sin to feed Russians. Kill them, and have done with it!'
They dispersed. When they had gone, the master came up to Zhílin and
said: 'If the money for your ransom is not sent within a fortnight, I will flog you;
and if you try to run away again, I'll kill you like a dog! Write a letter, and write
properly!'
Paper was brought to them, and they wrote the letters. Shackles were put
on their feet, and they were taken behind the Mosque to a deep pit about twelve
feet square, into which they were let down.

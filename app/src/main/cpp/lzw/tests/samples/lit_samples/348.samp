“Well, good-bye, my lad!” said Daddy Eróshka. “When you go on an expedition, be wise and listen to my words—the words of an old man. When you are out on a raid or the like (you know I’m an old wolf and have seen things), and when they begin firing, don’t get into a crowd where there are many men. When you fellows get frightened you always try to get close together with a lot of others. You think it is merrier to be with others, but that’s where it is worst of all! They always aim at a crowd. Now I used to keep farther away from the others and went alone, and I’ve never been wounded. Yet what things haven’t I seen in my day?”

“But you’ve got a bullet in your back,” remarked Vanyúsha, who was clearing up the room.

“That was the Cossacks fooling about,” answered Eróshka.

“Cossacks? How was that?” asked Olénin.

“Oh, just so. We were drinking. Vánka Sítkin, one of the Cossacks, got merry, and puff! he gave me one from his pistol just here.”

“Yes, and did it hurt?” asked Olénin. “Vanyúsha, will you soon be ready?” he added.

“Ah, where’s the hurry! Let me tell you. When he banged into me, the bullet did not break the bone but remained here. And I say: ‘You’ve killed me, brother. Eh! What have you done to me? I won’t let you off! You’ll have to stand me a pailful!’”

“Well, but did it hurt?” Olénin asked again, scarcely listening to the tale.

“Let me finish. He stood a pailful, and we drank it, but the blood went on flowing. The whole room was drenched and covered with blood. Grandad Burlák, he says, ‘The lad will give up the ghost. Stand a bottle of the sweet sort, or we shall have you taken up!’ They bought more drink, and boozed and boozed—”

“Yes, but did it hurt you much?” Olénin asked once more.

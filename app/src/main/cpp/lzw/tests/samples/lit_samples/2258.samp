still a large piece left.
'If Simon has had some dinner in town,' thought she, and does not eat
much for supper, the bread will last out another day.'
She weighed the piece of bread in her hand again and again, and thought:
'I won't make any more to-day. We have only enough flour left to bake one batch.
We can manage to make this last out till Friday.'
So Matryóna put away the bread, and sat down at the table to patch her
husband's shirt. While she worked she thought how her husband was buying
skins for a winter coat.
'If only the dealer does not cheat him. My good man is much too simple;
he cheats nobody, but any child can take him in. Eight roubles is a lot of money
-- he should get a good coat at that price. Not tanned skins, but still a proper
winter coat. How difficult it was last winter to get on without a warm coat. I
could neither get down to the river, nor go out anywhere. When he went out he
put on all we had, and there was nothing left for me. He did not start very early
to-day, but still it's time he was back. I only hope he has not gone on the spree!'
Hardly had Matryóna thought this, when steps were heard on the
threshold, and some one entered. Matryóna stuck her needle into her work and
went out into the passage. There she saw two men: Simon, and with him a man
without a hat, and wearing felt boots.

THE GODSON
'Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,
but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil.' -- Matt. v. 38, 39.
'Vengeance is mine; I will repay.' -- Rom. xii. 19.
I
A SON was born to a poor peasant. He was glad and went to his neighbour to
ask him to stand godfather to the boy. The neighbour refused -- he did not like
standing godfather to a poor man's child. The peasant asked another neighbour,
but he too refused, and after that the poor father went to every house in the
village, but found no one willing to be godfather to his son. So he set off to
another village, and on the way he met a man who stopped and said:
'Good-day, my good man; where are you off to?'
'God has given me a child,' said the peasant, 'to rejoice my eyes in youth,
to comfort my old age, and to pray for my soul after death. But I am poor, and no
one in our village will stand godfather to him, so I am now on my way to seek a
godfather for him elsewhere.'
'Let me be godfather,' said the stranger.
The peasant was glad, and thanked him, but added: 'And whom shall I
ask to be godmother?'

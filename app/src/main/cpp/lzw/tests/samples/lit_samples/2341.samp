'So that is how he got ahead of me,' thought Efím. 'God may or may not
have accepted my pilgrimage but He has certainly accepted his!'
Next morning Efím bade farewell to the people, who put some patties in
his sack before they went to their work, and he continued his journey.

Efím had been away just a year, and it was spring again when he reached
home one evening. His son was not at home, but had gone to the public-house
and when he came back, he had had a drop too much. Efím began questioning
him. Everything showed that the young fellow had been unsteady during his
father's absence. The money had all been wrongly spent, and the work had been
neglected. The father began to upbraid the son; and the son answered rudely.
'Why didn't you stay and look after it yourself?' he said. 'You go off,
taking the money with you and now you demand it of me!'
The old man grew angry, and struck his son.
In the morning Efím went to the village Elder to complain of his son's
conduct. As he was passing Elisha's house, his friend's wife greeted him from the
porch.
'How do you do, neighbour,' she said. 'How do you do, dear friend? Did
you get to Jerusalem safely?'
Efím stopped.

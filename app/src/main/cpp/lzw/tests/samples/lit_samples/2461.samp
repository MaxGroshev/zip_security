difficulty. He was done up with the heat, his bare feet were cut and bruised, and
his legs began to fail. He longed to rest, but it was impossible if he meant to get
back before sunset. The sun waits for no man, and it was sinking lower and

He looked towards the hillock and at the sun. He was still far from his
goal, and the sun was already near the rim
Pahóm walked on and on; it was very hard walking, but he went quicker

threw away his coat, his boots, his flask, and his cap, and kept only the spade

'What shall I do,' he thought again, 'I have grasped too much, and ruined
the whole affair. I can't get there before the sun sets.'
And this fear made him still more breathless. Pahóm went on running, his
soaking shirt and trousers stuck to him, and his mouth was parched. His breast
was working like a blacksmith's bellows, his heart was beating like a hammer,
and his legs were giving way as if they did not belong to him. Pahóm was seized
with terror lest he should die of the strain.

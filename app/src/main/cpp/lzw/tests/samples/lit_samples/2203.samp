as if on springs, came straight up to Zhílin, squatted down in front of him,
slapped him on the shoulder, and began to talk very fast in his own language.
His teeth showed, and he kept winking, clicking his tongue, and repeating, 'Good
Russ, good Russ.'
Zhílin could not understand a word, but said, 'Drink! give me water to
drink!'
The dark man only laughed. 'Good Russ,' he said, and went on talking in
his own tongue.
Zhílin made signs with lips and hands that he wanted something to drink.
The dark man understood, and laughed. Then he looked out of the door,
and called to some one: 'Dina!'
A little girl came running in: she was about thirteen, slight, thin, and like
the dark Tartar in face. Evidently she was his daughter. She, too, had clear black
eyes, and her face was good-looking. She had on a long blue gown with wide
sleeves, and no girdle. The hem of her gown, the front, and the sleeves, were
trimmed with red. She wore trousers and slippers, and over the slippers stouter
shoes with high heels. Round her neck she had a necklace made of Russian silver
coins. She was bareheaded, and her black hair was plaited with a ribbon and
ornamented with gilt braid and silver coins.
Her father gave an order, and she ran away and returned with a metal jug.

I gave wine to those who would drink it; and I got the land for less than
twopence an acre21. And he showed Pahóm the title-deeds, saying:
'The land lies near a river, and the whole prairie is virgin soil.'
Pahóm plied him with questions, and the tradesman said:
'There is more land there than you could cover if you walked a year, and it
all belongs to the Bashkírs. They are as simple as sheep, and land can be got
almost for nothing.'
'There now,' thought Pahóm, 'with my one thousand roubles, why should
I get only thirteen hundred acres, and saddle myself with a debt besides. If I take
it out there, I can get more than ten times as much for the money.'

Pahóm inquired how to get to the place, and as soon as the tradesman had
left him, he prepared to go there himself. He left his wife to look after the
homestead, and started on his journey taking his man with him. They stopped at
a town on their way, and bought a case of tea, some wine, and other presents, as
the tradesman had advised. On and on they went until they had gone more than
three hundred miles, and on the seventh day they came to a place where the
Bashkírs had pitched their tents. It was all just as the tradesman had said. The
people lived on the steppes, by a river, in felt-covered tents22. They neither tilled
the ground, nor ate bread. Their cattle and horses grazed in herds on the steppe.

cakes, or sometimes only unbaked dough.
Kostílin wrote home a second time, and did nothing but mope and wait
for the money to arrive. He would sit for days together in the barn sleeping, or
counting the days till a letter could come.
Zhílin knew his letter would reach no one, and he did not write another.
He thought: 'Where could my mother get enough money to ransom me? As it is
she lived chiefly on what I sent her. If she had to raise five hundred roubles, she
would be quite ruined. With God's help I'll manage to escape!'
So he kept on the look-out, planning how to run away.
He would walk about the Aoul whistling; or would sit working,
modelling dolls of clay, or weaving baskets out of twigs: for Zhílin was clever
with his hands.
Once he modelled a doll with a nose and hands and feet and with a Tartar
gown on, and put it up on the roof. When the Tartar women came out to fetch
water, the master's daughter, Dina, saw the doll and called the women, who put
down their jugs and stood looking and laughing. Zhílin took down the doll and
held it out to them. They laughed, but dared not take it. He put down the doll
and went into the barn, waiting to see what would happen.

Dina ran up to the doll, looked round, seized it, and ran away.

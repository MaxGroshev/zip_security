Then, with the Temple of Jerusalem -- the wonder of the ancient world -- restored
to its splendour, shall Israel be established a ruler over all nations.'
So spoke the Jew, and burst into tears. He wished to say more, but an
Italian missionary who was there interrupted him.
'What you are saying is untrue,' said he to the Jew. 'You attribute injustice
to God. He cannot love your nation above the rest. Nay rather, even if it be true
that of old He favoured the Israelites, it is now nineteen hundred years since they
angered Him, and caused Him to destroy their nation and scatter them over the
earth, so that their faith makes no converts and has died out except here and
there. God shows preference to no nation, but calls all who wish to be saved to
the bosom of the Catholic Church of Rome, the one outside whose borders no
salvation can be found.'
So spoke the Italian. But a Protestant minister who happened to be
present, growing pale, turned to the Catholic missionary and exclaimed:
'How can you say that salvation belongs to your religion? Those only will
be saved, who serve God according to the Gospel, in spirit and in truth, as
bidden by the word of Christ.'
Then a Turk, an office-holder in the custom-house at Surat, who was
sitting in the coffee-house smoking a pipe, turned with an air of superiority to
both the Christians.

“You know a tortoise? She’s a devil, the tortoise is!”

“Of course I know!”

“Find her nest and fence it round so that she can’t get in. Well, she’ll come, go round it, and then will go off to find the stone-break grass and will bring some along and destroy the fence. Anyhow next morning come in good time, and where the fence is broken there you’ll find the stone-break grass lying. Take it wherever you like. No lock and no bar will be able to stop you.”

“Have you tried it yourself, Daddy?”

“As for trying, I have not tried it, but I was told of it by good people. I used only one charm: that was to repeat the Pilgrim rhyme when mounting my horse; and no one ever killed me!”

“What is the Pilgrim rhyme, Daddy?”

“What, don’t you know it? Oh, what people! You’re right to ask Daddy. Well, listen, and repeat after me:

“Hail! Ye, living in Sion,
This is your King,
Our steeds we shall sit on,
Sophonius is weeping.
Zacharias is speaking,
Father Pilgrim,

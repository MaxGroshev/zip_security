Zhílin looked round and saw a red light to the left behind the hill. The
moon was just rising. 'Ah!' he thought, 'before the moon has risen I must have
passed the valley and be in the forest.' So he rose and threw away the stone.
Shackles or no, he must go on.
'Good-bye, Dina dear!' he said. 'I shall never forget you!'
Dina seized hold of him and felt about with her hands for a place to put
some cheeses she had brought. He took them from her.
'Thank you, my little one. Who will make dolls for you when I am gone?'
And he stroked her head.
Dina burst into tears hiding her face in her hands. Then she ran up the hill
like a young goat, the coins in her plait clinking against her back.
Zhílin crossed himself took the lock of his shackles in his hand to prevent
its clattering, and went along the road, dragging his shackled leg, and looking
towards the place where the moon was about to rise. He now knew the way. If he
went straight he would have to walk nearly six miles. If only he could reach the
wood before the moon had quite risen! He crossed the river; the light behind the
hill was growing whiter. Still looking at it, he went along the valley. The moon
was not yet visible. The light became brighter, and one side of the valley was
growing lighter and lighter, and shadows were drawing in towards the foot of
the hill, creeping nearer and nearer to him.

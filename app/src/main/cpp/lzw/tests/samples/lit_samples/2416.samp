took to drink. The eldest was killed in a brawl; and the younger, who had
married a self-willed woman, ceased to obey his father, and they could not live
together any more.
So they parted, and Ilyás gave his son a house and some of the cattle; and
this diminished his wealth. Soon after that, a disease broke out among Ilyás's
sheep, and many died. Then followed a bad harvest, and the hay crop failed; and
many cattle died that winter. Then the Kirghíz captured his best herd of horses;
and Ilyás's property dwindled away. It became smaller and smaller, while at the
same time his strength grew less; till, by the time he was seventy years old, he
had begun to sell his furs, carpets, saddles, and tents. At last he had to part with
his remaining cattle, and found himself face to face with want. Before he knew
how it had happened, he had lost everything, and in their old age he and his wife
had to go into service. Ilyás had nothing left, except the clothes on his back, a fur
cloak, a cup, his indoor shoes and overshoes, and his wife, Sham-Shemagi, who
also was old by this time. The son who had parted from him had gone into a far
country, and his daughter was dead, so that there was no one to help the old
couple.

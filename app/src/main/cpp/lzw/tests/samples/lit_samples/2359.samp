chips, which she was taking home. No doubt she had gathered them at some
place where building was going on. The sack evidently hurt her, and she wanted
to shift it from one shoulder to the other, so she put it down on the footpath and,
placing her basket on a post, began to shake down the chips in the sack. While
she was doing this a boy in a tattered cap ran up, snatched an apple out of the
basket, and tried to slip away; but the old woman noticed it, and turning, caught
the boy by his sleeve. He began to struggle, trying to free himself, but the old
woman held on with both hands, knocked his cap off his head, and seized hold
of his hair. The boy screamed and the old woman scolded. Martin dropped his
awl, not waiting to stick it in its place, and rushed out of the door. Stumbling up
the steps, and dropping his spectacles in his hurry, he ran out into the street. The
old woman was pulling the boy's hair and scolding him, and threatening to take
him to the police. The lad was struggling and protesting, saying, 'I did not take it.
What are you beating me for? Let me go!'
Martin separated them. He took the boy by the hand and said, 'Let him go,
Granny. Forgive him for Christ's sake.'
'I'll pay him out, so that he won't forget it for a year! I'll take the rascal to
the police!'
Martin began entreating the old woman.
'Let him go, Granny. He won't do it again. Let him go for Christ's sake!'

     In this, dear reader, if you know it,
     show me the sense. Divine decree
     may wind up my career as poet;
     perhaps, though Phoebus warns, I'll see

     may then amuse my glad decline.

     shall make my story grim as hell;
     no, quite naively I'll retell
     a Russian family's old traditions;

with surprise by the other guests in the coffee-house. They were astonished at the
master's question, and yet more so at the slave's reply.
One of them, a Brahmin, on hearing the words spoken by the slave, turned
to him and said:
'Miserable fool! Is it possible you believe that God can be carried under a
man's girdle? There is one God -- Brahma, and he is greater than the whole
world, for he created it. Brahma is the One, the mighty God, and in His honour
are built the temples on the Ganges' banks, where his true priests, the Brahmins,
worship him. They know the true God, and none but they. A thousand score of
years have passed, and yet through revolution after revolution these priests have
held their sway, because Brahma, the one true God, has protected them.'

So spoke the Brahmin, thinking to convince every one; but a Jewish broker
who was present replied to him, and said:
'No! the temple of the true God is not in India. Neither does God protect
the Brahmin caste. The true God is not the God of the Brahmins, but of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. None does He protect but His chosen people, the Israelites.
From the commencement of the world, our nation has been beloved of Him, and
ours alone. If we are now scattered over the whole earth it is but to try us; for
God has promised that He will one day gather His people together in Jerusalem.

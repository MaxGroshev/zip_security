their tongues did nagging, and every word was a bad one.
At first the peasants only slandered one another; but afterwards they
began in real earnest to snatch anything that lay handy, and the children

the judges were tired of them. Now Gabriel got Iván fined or imprisoned; then
Iván did as much to Gabriel; and the more they spited each other the angrier they
grew -- like dogs that attack one another and get more and more furious the

other of them was fined or locked up, but that only made them more and more
angry with each other. 'Wait a bit,' they said, 'and I'll make you pay for it.' And so
it went on for six years. Only the old man lying on the top of the oven kept
telling them again and again: 'Children, what are you doing? Stop all this paying

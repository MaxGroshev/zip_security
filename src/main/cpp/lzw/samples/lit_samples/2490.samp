threatened the hermit with it. The latter was alarmed, and ran away further into
the forest.
The robber did not follow him, but only shouted:
'Twice I have let you off, old man, but next time you come in my way I
will kill you!'
Having said this, he rode away. In the evening when the godson went to
water his stumps -- one of them was sprouting! A little apple tree was growing
out of it.

After hiding himself from everybody, the godson lived all alone. When his
supply of bread was exhausted, he thought: 'Now I must go and look for some
roots to eat.' He had not gone far, however, before he saw a bag of dried bread
hanging on a branch. He took it down, and as long as it lasted he lived upon that.
When he had eaten it all, he found another bagful on the same branch. So
he lived on, his only trouble being his fear of the robber. Whenever he heard the
robber passing he hid thinking:
'He may kill me before I have had time to atone for my sins.'
In this way he lived for ten more years. The one apple-tree continued to
grow, but the other two stumps remained exactly as they were.

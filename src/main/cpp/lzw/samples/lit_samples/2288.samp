brother-in-law, Tarás, said: 'Your Biddy laid its egg in the neighbour's yard. It
was there she was cackling, and she flew back across the fence from there.'
The woman went and looked at the hen. There she was on the perch with
the other birds, her eyes just closing ready to go to sleep. The woman wished she
could have asked the hen and got an answer from her.
Then she went to the neighbour's, and Gabriel's mother came out to meet
her.
'What do you want, young woman?'
'Why, Granny, you see, my hen flew across this morning. Did she not lay
an egg here?'
'We never saw anything of it. The Lord be thanked, our own hens started
laying long ago. We collect our own eggs and have no need of other people's!
And we don't go looking for eggs in other people's yards, lass!'
The young woman was offended, and said more than she should have
done. Her neighbour answered back with interest, and the women began abusing
each other. Ivan's wife, who had been to fetch water, happening to pass just then,
joined in too. Gabriel's wife rushed out, and began reproaching the young
woman with things that had really happened and with other things that never
had happened at all. Then a general uproar commenced, all shouting at once,
trying to get out two words at a time, and not choice words either.

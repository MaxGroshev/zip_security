any one had time to fire he had run past. He had grown ferocious, and wanted to
gnaw me again, but seeing so many people he took fright. We saw by his track
that his head was bleeding and we wanted to follow him up; but, as my wounds
had become very painful, we went, instead, to the town to find a doctor.
The doctor stitched up my wounds with silk, and they soon began to heal.
A month later we went to hunt that bear again, but I did not get a chance
of finishing him. He would not come out of the circle, but went round and round
growling in a terrible voice.
Damian killed him. The bear's lower jaw had been broken, and one of his
teeth knocked out by my bullet.
He was a huge creature, and had splendid black fur.
I had him stuffed, and he now lies in my room. The wounds on my
forehead healed up so that the scars can scarcely be seen.

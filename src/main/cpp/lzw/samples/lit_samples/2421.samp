steal our horses. We lay awake at night, worrying lest the ewes should overlie
their lambs, and we got up again and again to see that all was well. One thing
attended to, another care would spring up: how, for instance, to get enough
fodder for the winter. And besides that, my old man and I used to disagree. He
would say we must do so and so, and I would differ from him; and then we
disputed -- sinning again. So we passed from one trouble to another, from one
sin to another, and found no happiness.'
'Well, and now?'
'Now, when my husband and I wake in the morning, we always have a
loving word for one another and we live peacefully, having nothing to quarrel
about. We have no care but how best to serve our master. We work as much as
our strength allows and do it with a will, that our master may not lose but profit
by us. When we come in, dinner or supper is ready and there is kumiss to drink.
We have fuel to burn when it is cold and we have our fur cloak. And we have

time to talk, time to think of our souls, and time to pray. For fifty years we
sought happiness, but only now at last have we found it.'

“Your health!” said Lukáshka, taking from his mother’s hands a cup filled to the brim with chikhir and carefully raising it to his bowed head.

“A bad business!” said Nazárka. “You heard how Daddy Burlák said, ‘Have you stolen many horses?’ He seems to know!”

“A regular wizard!” Lukáshka replied shortly. “But what of it!” he added, tossing his head. “They are across the river by now. Go and find them!”

“Still it’s a bad lookout.”

“What’s a bad lookout? Go and take some chikhir to him tomorrow and nothing will come of it. Now let’s make merry. Drink!” shouted Lukáshka, just in the tone in which old Eróshka uttered the word. “We’ll go out into the street and make merry with the girls. You go and get some honey; or no, I’ll send our dumb wench. We’ll make merry till morning.”

Nazárka smiled.

“Are we stopping here long?” he asked.

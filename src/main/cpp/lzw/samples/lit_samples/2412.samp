the water, and the smaller one was going to step into the puddle, shoes and all,
when the elder checked her:
'Don't go in so, Malásha,' said she, 'your mother will scold you. I will take
off my shoes and stockings, and you take off yours.'
They did so, and then, picking up their skirts, began walking towards
each other through the puddle. The water came up to Malásha's ankles, and she
said:
'It is deep, Akoúlya, I'm afraid!'
'Come on,' replied the other. 'Don't be frightened. It won't get any deeper.'
When they got near one another, Akoúlya said:
'Mind, Malásha, don't splash. Walk carefully!'
She had hardly said this, when Malásha plumped down her foot so that
the water splashed right on to Akoúlya's frock. The frock was splashed, and so
were Akoúlya's eyes and nose. When she saw the stains on her frock, she was
angry and ran after Malásha to strike her. Malásha was frightened, and seeing
that she had got herself into trouble, she scrambled out of the puddle, and
prepared to run home. Just then Akoúlya's mother happened to be passing, and
seeing that her daughter's skirt was splashed, and her sleeves dirty, she said:
'You naughty, dirty girl, what have you been doing?'
'Malásha did it on purpose,' replied the girl.

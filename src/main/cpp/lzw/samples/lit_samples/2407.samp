'Well!' says Iván, 'the fine gentleman told the truth when he said that
"sometimes one's head quite splits." This is worse than blisters; after such work
there will be swellings on the head.'
The old Devil tumbled out at the foot of the stairs, and struck his head
against the ground. Iván was about to go up to him to see how much work he
had done -- when suddenly the earth opened and the old Devil fell through.
Only a hole was left.
Iván scratched his head.
'What a nasty thing,' says he. 'It's one of those devils again! What a
whopper! He must be the father of them all.'
Iván is still living, and people crowd to his kingdom. His own brothers
have come to live with him, and he feeds them, too. To every one who comes and
says 'Give me food!' Iván says, 'All right. You can stay with us; we have plenty of
everything.'
Only there is one special custom in his kingdom; whoever has horny
hands comes to table, but whoever has not, must eat what the others leave.

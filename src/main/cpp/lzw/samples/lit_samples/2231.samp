'I can't!' she said, 'they would see me bringing it. They're all at home.' And
she went away.
So when evening came Zhílin still sat looking up now and then, and
wondering what would happen. The stars were there, but the moon had not yet
risen. The Mullah's voice was heard; then all was silent. Zhílin was beginning to
doze, thinking: 'The girl will be afraid to do it!'
Suddenly he felt clay falling on his head. He looked up, and saw a long
pole poking into the opposite wall of the pit. It kept poking about for a time, and
then it came down, sliding into the pit. Zhílin was glad indeed. He took hold of it
and lowered it. It was a strong pole, one that he had seen before on the roof of his
master's hut.
He looked up. The stars were shining high in the sky, and just above the
pit Dina's eyes gleamed in the dark like a cat's. She stooped with her face close to
the edge of the pit, and whispered, 'Iván! Iván!' waving her hand in front of her
face to show that he should speak low.
'What?' said Zhílin.
'All but two have gone away.'
Then Zhílin said, 'Well, Kostílin, come; let us have one last try; I'll help
you up.'
But Kostílin would not hear of it.

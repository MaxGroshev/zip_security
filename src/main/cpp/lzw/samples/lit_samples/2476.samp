called together other peasants to help him, and Vasíly was beaten, bound, and
taken to prison.
Then the godson looked at the town, where his godmother lived. He saw
that she was now married to a tradesman. She lay asleep, and her husband rose
and went to his mistress. The godson shouted to her:
'Get up, get up, your husband has taken to evil ways.'
The godmother jumped up and dressed, and finding out where her
husband was, she shamed and beat his mistress, and drove him away.
Then the godson looked for his mother, and saw her lying asleep in her
cottage. And a thief crept into the cottage and began to break open the chest in
which she kept her things. The mother awoke and screamed, and the robber
seizing an axe, swung it over his head to kill her.
The godson could not refrain from hurling the sceptre at the robber. It
struck him upon the temple, and killed him on the spot.

As soon as the godson had killed the robber, the walls closed and the hall
became just as it had been before.
Then the door opened and the godfather entered, and coming up to his
godson he took him by the hand and led him down from the throne.

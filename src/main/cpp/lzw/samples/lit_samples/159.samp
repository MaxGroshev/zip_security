“Wait a moment,” he said to Gerasim. “I’ll be right back.”

“Very well.”

Yegor came back and reported that inside of half an hour he would have to have the horses harnessed, ready to drive his master to town. He lighted his pipe and took several turns in the room. Then he came to a halt in front of Gerasim.

“Listen, my boy,” he said, “if you want, I’ll ask my master to take you as a servant here.”

“Does he need a man?”

“We have one, but he’s not much good. He’s getting old, and it’s very hard for him to do the work. It’s lucky for us that the neighbourhood isn’t a lively one and the police don’t make a fuss about things being kept just so, else the old man couldn’t manage to keep the place clean enough for them.”

“Oh, if you can, then please do say a word for me, Yegor Danilych. I’ll pray for you all my life. I can’t stand being without work any longer.”

“All right, I’ll speak for you. Come again to-morrow, and in the meantime take this ten-kopek piece. It may come in handy.”

“Thanks, Yegor Danilych. Then you will try for me? Please do me the favour.”

“All right. I’ll try for you.”

Then the second imp, who had Tarás in hand, began to tell how he had
fared. 'I don't want any help,' said he, 'my job is going all right. Tarás can't hold
out for more than a week. First I caused him to grow greedy and fat. His
covetousness became so great that whatever he saw he wanted to buy. He has
89
spent all his money in buying immense lots of goods, and still continues to buy.
Already he has begun to use borrowed money. His debts hang like a weight
round his neck, and he is so involved that he can never get clear. In a week his
bills come due, and before then I will spoil all his stock. He will be unable to pay
and will have to go home to his father.'
Then they asked the third imp (Ivan's), 'And how are you getting on?'
'Well,' said he, 'my affair goes badly. First I spat into his drink to make his
stomach ache, and then I went into his field and hammered the ground hard as a
stone that he should not be able to till it. I thought he wouldn't plough it, but like
the fool that he is, he came with his plough and began to make a furrow. He
groaned with the pain in his stomach, but went on ploughing. I broke his plough
for him, but he went home, got out another, and again started ploughing. I crept
under the earth and caught hold of the ploughshares, but there was no holding
them; he leant heavily upon the plough, and the ploughshare was sharp and cut
my hands. He has all but finished ploughing the field, only one little strip is left.

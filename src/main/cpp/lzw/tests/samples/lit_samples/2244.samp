Damian was there too; and when we arrived the people got up, and
Damian led them away to place them in the circle we had made the day before.
They went along in single file, men and women, thirty in all. The snow was so
deep that we could only see them from their waists upwards. They turned into
the forest, and my friend and I followed in their track.
Though they had trodden a path, walking was difficult, but, on the other
hand, it was impossible to fall: it was like walking between two walls of snow.
We went on in this way for nearly half a mile, when all at once we saw
Damian coming from another direction -- running towards us on his snowshoes,
and beckoning us to join him. We went towards him, and he showed us where to
stand. I took my place, and looked round me.
To my left were tall fir trees, between the trunks of which I could see a
good way, and, like a black patch just visible behind the trees, I could see a
beater. In front of me was a thicket of young firs, about as high as a man, their
branches weighed down and stuck together with snow. Through this copse ran a
path thickly covered with snow, and leading straight up to where I stood. The
thicket stretched away to the right of me, and ended in a small glade, where I
could see Damian placing my comrade.
I examined both my guns, and considered where I had better stand. Three
steps behind me was a tall fir.

“Hold your tongue, swine!” exclaimed the old man, laughing. “What a stingy fellow!”

Maryánka came out of the cowshed, glanced indifferently at the cart, bowed and went towards the hut.

“La fille!” said Vanyúsha, with a wink, and burst out into a silly laugh.

“Drive on!” shouted Olénin, angrily.

“Good-bye, my lad! Good-bye. I won’t forget you!” shouted Eróshka.

Olénin turned round. Daddy Eróshka was talking to Maryánka, evidently about his own affairs, and neither the old man nor the girl looked at Olénin.

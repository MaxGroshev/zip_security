“Have done with your humbugging!” said Ergushóv again, rubbing his eyes.

“Have done with what? Look there,” said Lukáshka, seizing him by the shoulders and pulling him with such force that Ergushóv groaned.

He looked in the direction in which Lukáshka pointed, and discerning a body immediately changed his tone.

“O Lord! But I say, more will come! I tell you the truth,” said he softly, and began examining his musket. “That was a scout swimming across: either the others are here already or are not far off on the other side—I tell you for sure!” Lukáshka was unfastening his belt and taking off his Circassian coat.

“What are you up to, you idiot?” exclaimed Ergushóv. “Only show yourself and you’ve lost all for nothing, I tell you true! If you’ve killed him he won’t escape. Let me have a little powder for my musket-pan—you have some? Nazárka, you go back to the cordon and look alive; but don’t go along the bank or you’ll be killed—I tell you true.”

“Catch me going alone! Go yourself!” said Nazárka angrily.

Having taken off his coat, Lukáshka went down to the bank.

“Don’t go in, I tell you!” said Ergushóv, putting some powder on the pan. “Look, he’s not moving. I can see. It’s nearly morning; wait till they come from the cordon. You go, Nazárka. You’re afraid! Don’t be afraid, I tell you.”

“Luke, I say, Lukáshka! Tell us how you did it!” said Nazárka.

Lukáshka changed his mind about going into the water just then. “Go quick to the cordon and I will watch. Tell the Cossacks to send out the patrol. If the abreks are on this side they must be caught,” said he.

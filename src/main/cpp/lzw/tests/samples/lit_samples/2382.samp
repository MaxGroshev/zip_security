'Really!' said he; 'Why didn't you say so before? I'll make you as many as
you like. It's well the lass and I have thrashed so much straw.'
Iván took his brother to the barn and said:
'Look here; if I make you some soldiers, you must take them away at once,
for if we have to feed them, they will eat up the whole village in a day.'
Simon the Soldier promised to lead the soldiers away; and Iván began to
make them. He bumped a sheaf on the thrashing floor -- a company appeared.
He bumped another sheaf, and there was a second company. He made so many
that they covered the field.
'Will that do?' he asked.
Simon was overjoyed, and said: 'That will do! Thank you, Iván!'
'All right' said Iván. 'If you want more, come back, and I'll make them.
There is plenty of straw this season.'
Simon the Soldier at once took command of his army, collected and
organized it, and went off to make war.
Hardly had Simon the Soldier gone, when Tarás the Stout came along. He,
too, had heard of yesterday's affair, and he said to his brother:
'Show me where you get gold money! If I only had some to start with, I
could make it bring me in money from all over the world.'
Iván was astonished.

shouted and argued; the word 'Russians' was repeated several times. He could
hear the voice of the old man. Though he could not distinguish what was said, he
guessed that Russian troops were somewhere near, and that the Tartars, afraid
they might come into the Aoul, did not know what to do with their prisoners.
After talking awhile, they went away. Suddenly he heard a rustling
overhead, and saw Dina crouching at the edge of the pit, her knees higher than
her head, and bending over so that the coins of her plait dangled above the pit.
Her eyes gleamed like stars. She drew two cheeses out of her sleeve and threw
them to him. Zhílin took them and said, 'Why did you not come before? I have
made some toys for you. Here, catch!' And he began throwing the toys up, one
by one.
But she shook her head and would not look at them.
'I don't want any,' she said. She sat silent for awhile, and then went on,
'Iván, they want to kill you!' And she pointed to her own throat.
'Who wants to kill me?'
'Father; the old men say he must. But I am sorry for you!'
Zhílin answered: 'Well, if you are sorry for me, bring me a long pole.'
She shook her head, as much as to say, 'I can't!'
He clasped his hands and prayed her: 'Dina, please do! Dear Dina, I beg of
you!'

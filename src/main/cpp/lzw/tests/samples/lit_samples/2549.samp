awoke in the morning, it was long before he could remember where he was, or
who was the strange bearded man lying on the bed and gazing intently at him
with shining eyes.
'Forgive me!' said the bearded man in a weak voice, when he saw that the
King was awake and was looking at him.
'I do not know you, and have nothing to forgive you for,' said the King.
'You do not know me, but I know you. I am that enemy of yours who
swore to revenge himself on you, because you executed his brother and seized
his property. I knew you had gone alone to see the hermit, and I resolved to kill
175
you on your way back. But the day passed and you did not return. So I came out
from my ambush to find you, and I came upon your bodyguard, and they
recognized me, and wounded me. I escaped from them, but should have bled to
death had you not dressed my wound. I wished to kill you, and you have saved
my life. Now, if I live, and if you wish it, I will serve you as your most faithful
slave, and will bid my sons do the same. Forgive me!'
The King was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily, and
to have gained him for a friend, and he not only forgave him, but said he would
send his servants and his own physician to attend him, and promised to restore
his property.

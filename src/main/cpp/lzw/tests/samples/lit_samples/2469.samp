'Go to the town,' replied the stranger, 'and, in the square, you will see a
stone house with shop-windows in the front. At the entrance you will find the
tradesman to whom it belongs. Ask him to let his daughter stand godmother to
your child.'
The peasant hesitated.
'How can I ask a rich tradesman?' said he. 'He will despise me, and will
not let his daughter come.'
'Don't trouble about that. Go and ask. Get everything ready by to-morrow
morning, and I will come to the christening.'
The poor peasant returned home, and then drove to the town to find the
tradesman. He had hardly taken his horse into the yard, when the tradesman
himself came out.
'What do you want?' said he.
'Why, sir,' said the peasant, 'you see God has given me a son to rejoice my
eyes in youth, to comfort my old age, and to pray for my soul after death. Be so
kind as to let your daughter stand godmother to him.
'And when is the christening?' said the tradesman.
'To-morrow morning.'
'Very well. Go in peace. She shall be with you at Mass to-morrow
morning.'

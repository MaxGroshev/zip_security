“I say, Lukáshka, that fiend will be sending us to the ambush again tonight,” he said, taking up the bird. (He was alluding to the corporal.) “He has sent Fómushkin to get wine, and it ought to be his turn. He always puts it on us.”

Lukáshka went whistling along the cordon.

“Take the string with you,” he shouted.

Nazirka obeyed.

“I’ll give him a bit of my mind today, I really will,” continued Nazárka. “Let’s say we won’t go; we’re tired out and there’s an end of it! No, really, you tell him, he’ll listen to you. It’s too bad!”

“Get along with you! What a thing to make a fuss about!” said Lukáshka, evidently thinking of something else. “What bosh! If he made us turn out of the village at night now, that would be annoying: there one can have some fun, but here what is there? It’s all one whether we’re in the cordon or in ambush. What a fellow you are!”

“And are you going to the village?”

“I’ll go for the holidays.”

“Gúrka says your Dunáyka is carrying on with Fómushkin,” said Nazárka suddenly.

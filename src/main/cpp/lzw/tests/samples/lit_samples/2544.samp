nursed them without compassion, or even with disgust. Moreover, people
considered many of the illnesses infectious, and, fearing to catch them, not only
avoided the sick, but even separated themselves from those who attended the
sick.
Then God said to Himself: 'If even this means will not bring men to
understand wherein their happiness lies, let them be taught by suffering.' And
God left men to themselves.
And, left to themselves, men lived long before they understood that they
all ought to, and might be, happy. Only in the very latest times have a few of
them begun to understand that work ought not to be a bugbear to some and like
galley-slavery for others, but should be a common and happy occupation,
uniting all men. They have begun to understand that with death constantly
threatening each of us, the only reasonable business of every man is to spend the
years, months, hours, and minutes, allotted him -- in unity and love. They have
begun to understand that sickness, far from dividing men, should, on the
contrary, give opportunity for loving union with one another.

Olénin looked intently, but could not see anything. The Cossacks soon distinguished two riders and quietly rode straight towards them.

“Are those the abreks?” asked Olénin.

The Cossacks did not answer his question, which appeared quite meaningless to them. The abreks would have been fools to venture across the river on horseback.

“That’s friend Ródka waving to us, I do believe,” said Lukáshka, pointing to the two mounted men who were now clearly visible. “Look, he’s coming to us.”

A few minutes later it became plain that the two horsemen were the Cossack scouts. The corporal rode up to Lukáshka.

“Are they far?” was all Lukáshka said.

Just then they heard a sharp shot some thirty paces off. The corporal smiled slightly.

“Our Gúrka is having shots at them,” he said, nodding in the direction of the shot.

Having gone a few paces farther they saw Gúrka sitting behind a sand-hillock and loading his gun. To while away the time he was exchanging shots with the abreks, who were behind another sand-heap. A bullet came whistling from their side.

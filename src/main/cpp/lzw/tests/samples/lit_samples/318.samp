Nazárka spoke very loud, and evidently did so intentionally, adding: “Just see what a clever cadet!”

Olénin trembled and grew pale.

“Come here, here!” He seized the Cossack firmly by the arm and drew him towards his hut.

“Nothing happened, she did not let me in, and I too mean no harm. She is an honest girl—”

“Eh, discuss—”

“Yes, but all the same I’ll give you something now. Wait a bit!”

Nazárka said nothing. Olénin ran into his hut and brought out ten rubles, which he gave to the Cossack.

“Nothing happened, but still I was to blame, so I give this!—Only for God’s sake don’t let anyone know, for nothing happened...”

“I wish you joy,” said Nazárka laughing, and went away.

Nazárka had come to the village that night at Lukáshka’s bidding to find a place to hide a stolen horse, and now, passing by on his way home, had heard the sound of footsteps. When he returned next morning to his company he bragged to his chum, and told him how cleverly he had got ten rubles. Next morning Olénin met his hosts and they knew nothing about the events of the night. He did not speak to Maryánka, and she only laughed a little when she looked at him. Next night he also passed without sleep, vainly wandering about the yard. The day after he purposely spent shooting, and in the evening he went to see Belétski to escape from his own thoughts. He was afraid of himself, and promised himself not to go to his hosts’ hut any more.

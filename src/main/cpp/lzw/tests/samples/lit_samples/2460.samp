down, thinking that if he did he might fall asleep. After sitting a little while, he
went on again. At first he walked easily: the food had strengthened him; but it
had become terribly hot, and he felt sleepy; still he went on, thinking: 'An hour to
suffer, a life-time to live.'
He went a long way in this direction also, and was about to turn to the left
again, when he perceived a damp hollow: 'It would be a pity to leave that out,' he
thought. 'Flax would do well there.' So he went on past the hollow, and dug a
hole on the other side of it before he turned the corner. Pahóm looked towards
the hillock. The heat made the air hazy: it seemed to be quivering, and through
the haze the people on the hillock could scarcely be seen.
'Ah!' thought Pahóm, 'I have made the sides too long; I must make this
one shorter.' And he went along the third side stepping faster. He looked at the
sun: it was nearly half way to the horizon, and he had not yet done two miles of

'No,' he thought, 'though it will make my land lop-sided, I must hurry
back in a straight line now. I might go too far, and as it is I have a great deal of
land.'
So Pahóm hurriedly dug a hole, and turned straight towards the hillock.

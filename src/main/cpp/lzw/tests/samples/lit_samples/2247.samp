then I saw my friend raise his gun and aim in the same direction. Crack! He fired.
'There,' thought I. 'He has killed him.'
But I saw that my comrade did not run towards the bear. Evidently he had
missed him, or the shot had not taken full effect.
'The bear will get away,' I thought. 'He will go back, but he won't come a
second time towards me. -- But what is that?'
Something was coming towards me like a whirlwind, snorting as it came;
and I saw the snow flying up quite near me. I glanced straight before me, and
there was the bear, rushing along the path through the thicket right at me,
evidently beside himself with fear. He was hardly half a dozen paces off, and I
could see the whole of him -- his black chest and enormous head with a reddish
patch. There he was, blundering straight at me, and scattering the snow about as
he came. I could see by his eyes that he did not see me, but, mad with fear, was
rushing blindly along; and his path led him straight at the tree under which I was
standing. I raised my gun and fired. He was almost upon me now, and I saw that
I had missed. My bullet had gone past him, and he did not even hear me fire, but
still came headlong towards me. I lowered my gun, and fired again, almost
touching his head. Crack! I had hit, but not killed him!
He raised his head, and laying his ears back, came at me, showing his
teeth.

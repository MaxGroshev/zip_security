'If we're alive we shall find something to eat.'
The woman lay still awhile, and then said, 'He seems a good man, but
why does he not tell us who he is?'
'I suppose he has his reasons.'
'Simon!'
'Well?'
'We give; but why does nobody give us anything?'
 Simon did not know what to say; so he only said, 'Let us stop talking,' and
turned over and went to sleep.

In the morning Simon awoke. The children were still asleep; his wife had
gone to the neighbour's to borrow some bread. The stranger alone was sitting on
the bench, dressed in the old shirt and trousers, and looking upwards. His face
was brighter than it had been the day before.
Simon said to him, 'Well, friend; the belly wants bread and the naked
body clothes. One has to work for a living. What work do you know?'
'I do not know any.'
This surprised Simon, but he said, 'Men who want to learn can learn
anything.'
'Men work, and I will work also.'

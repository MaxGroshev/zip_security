“Yes, I know,” said Lukáshka; “that’s so!”

“If you wish to be a fellow of the right sort, be a brave and not a peasant! Because even a peasant can buy a horse—pay the money and take the horse.”

They were silent for a while.

“Well, of course it’s dull both in the village and the cordon, Daddy: but there’s nowhere one can go for a bit of sport. All our fellows are so timid. Take Nazárka. The other day when we went to the Tartar village, Giréy Khan asked us to come to Nogáy to take some horses, but no one went, and how was I to go alone?”

“And what of Daddy? Do you think I am quite dried up? ... No, I’m not dried up. Let me have a horse and I’ll be off to Nogáy at once.”

“What’s the good of talking nonsense!” said Luke. “You’d better tell me what to do about Giréy Khan. He says, ‘Only bring horses to the Térek, and then even if you bring a whole stud I’ll find a place for them.’ You see he’s also a shaven-headed Tartar—how’s one to believe him?”

“You may trust Giréy Khan, all his kin were good people. His father too was a faithful kunak. But listen to Daddy and I won’t teach you wrong: make him take an oath, then it will be all right. And if you go with him, have your pistol ready all the same, especially when it comes to dividing up the horses. I was nearly killed that way once by a Chéchen. I wanted ten rubles from him for a horse. Trusting is all right, but don’t go to sleep without a gun.” Lukáshka listened attentively to the old man.

“I say, Daddy, have you any stone-break grass?” he asked after a pause.

“No, I haven’t any, but I’ll teach you how to get it. You’re a good lad and won’t forget the old man.... Shall I tell you?”

“Tell me, Daddy.”

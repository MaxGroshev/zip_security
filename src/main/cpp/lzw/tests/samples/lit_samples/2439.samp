I
AN elder sister came to visit her younger sister in the country. The elder was
married to a tradesman in town, the younger to a peasant in the village. As the
sisters sat over their tea talking, the elder began to boast of the advantages of
town life: saying how comfortably they lived there, how well they dressed, what
fine clothes her children wore what good things they ate and drank, and how she
went to the theatre, promenades, and entertainments.
The younger sister was piqued, and in turn disparage the life of a
tradesman, and stood up for that of a peasant.
'I would not change my way of life for yours,' said she. We may live
roughly, but at least we are free from anxiety. You live in better style than we do
but though you often earn more than you need, you are very likely to lose all you
have. You know the proverb, "Loss and gain are brothers twain." It often
happens that people who are wealthy one day are begging their bread the next.
Our way is safer. Though a peasant's life is not a fat one, it is a long one. We shall
never grow rich, but we shall always have enough to eat.'
The elder sister said sneeringly:
'Enough? Yes, if you like to share with the pigs and the calves! What do
you know of elegance or manners! However much your goodman may slave,
you will die as you are living -- on a dung heap -- and your children the same.'

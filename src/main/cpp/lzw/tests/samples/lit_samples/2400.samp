103
The fools were astonished; there was no money in use among them; they
bartered their goods, and paid one another with labour. They looked at the gold
coins with surprise.
'What nice little things they are!' said they.
And they began to exchange their goods and labour for the gentleman's
gold pieces. And the old Devil began, as in Tarás's kingdom, to be free with his
gold, and the people began to exchange everything for gold and to do all sorts of
work for it.
The old Devil was delighted, and thought he to himself, 'Things are going
right this time. Now I shall ruin the Fool as I did Tarás, and I shall buy him up
body and soul.'
But as soon as the fools had provided themselves with gold pieces they
gave them to the women for necklaces. The lasses plaited them into their tresses,
and at last the children in the street began to play with the little pieces.
Everybody had plenty of them, and they stopped taking them. But the fine
gentleman's mansion was not yet half-built, and the grain and cattle for the year
were not yet provided. So he gave notice that he wished people to come and
work for him, and that he wanted cattle and grain; for each thing, and for each
service, he was ready to give many more pieces of gold.

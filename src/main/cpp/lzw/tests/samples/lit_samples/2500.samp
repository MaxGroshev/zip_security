from behind.
Emelyán looked round and saw a lovely lassie, who said to him: 'Why
don't you get married, Emelyán?'
'How can I marry, my lass?' said he. 'I have but the clothes I stand up in,
nothing more, and no one would have me for a husband.'
'Take me for a wife,' said she.
Emelyán liked the maid. 'I should be glad to,' said he, 'but where and how
could we live?'
'Why trouble about that?' said the girl. 'One only has to work more and
sleep less, and one can clothe and feed oneself anywhere.'
'Very well then, let us marry,' said Emelyán. 'Where shall we go to?'
'Let us go to town.'
So Emelyán and the lass went to town, and she took him to a small hut on
the very edge of the town, and they married and began housekeeping.
One day the King, driving through the town, passed by Emelyán's hut.
Emelyán's wife came out to see the King. The King noticed her and was quite
surprised.
'Where did such a beauty come from?' said he and stopping his carriage
he called Emelyán's wife and asked her: 'Who are you?'
'The peasant Emelyán's wife,' said she.

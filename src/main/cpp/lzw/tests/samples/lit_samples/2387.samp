His father and mother called Iván, and said to him: 'Have you heard what
the King has proclaimed? You said you had a root that would cure any sickness.
Go and heal the King's daughter, and you will be made happy for life.'
'All right,' said he.
And Iván prepared to go, and they dressed him in his best. But as he went
out of the door he met a beggar woman with a crippled hand.
'I have heard,' said she, 'that you can heal people. I pray you cure my arm,
for I cannot even put on my boots myself.'
'All right,' said Iván, and giving the little root to the beggar woman he told
her to swallow it. She swallowed it, and was cured. She was at once able to move
her arm freely.
His father and mother came out to accompany Iván to the King, but when
they heard that he had given away the root, and that he had nothing left to cure
the King's daughter with, they began to scold him.
'You pity a beggar woman, but are not sorry for the King's daughter!' said
they. But Iván felt sorry for the King's daughter also. So he harnessed the horse,
put straw in the cart to sit on, and sat down to drive away.
'Where are you going, fool?'
'To cure the King's daughter.'
'But you've nothing left to cure her with?'

going.
'I am a robber,' the man answered, drawing rein. 'I ride about the
highways killing people; and the more I kill, the merrier are the songs I sing.'
The godson was horror-struck, and thought:
'How can the evil be destroyed in such a man as this? It is easy to speak to
those who come to me of their own accord and confess their sins. But this one
boasts of the evil he does.'
So he said nothing, and turned away, thinking: 'What am I to do now?
This robber may take to riding about here, and he will frighten away the people.
They will leave off coming to me. It will be a loss to them, and I shall not know
how to live.'
So the godson turned back, and said to the robber:
'People come to me here, not to boast of their sins, but to repent, and to
pray for forgiveness. Repent of your sins, if you fear God; but if there is no
repentance in your heart, then go away and never come here again. Do not
trouble me, and do not frighten people away from me. If you do not hearken,
God will punish you.'
The robber laughed:
'I am not afraid of God, and I will not listen to you. You are not my
master,' said he. 'You live by your piety, and I by my robbery. We all must live.

They were both silent.

He took out his knife and began silently to cut off the clusters. He reached from under the leaves low down a thick bunch weighing about three pounds, the grapes of which grew so close that they flattened each other for want of space. He showed it to Maryánka.

“Must they all be cut? Isn’t this one too green?”

“Give it here.”

Their hands touched. Olénin took her hand, and she looked at him smiling.

“Are you going to be married soon?” he asked.

She did not answer, but turned away with a stern look.

“Do you love Lukáshka?”

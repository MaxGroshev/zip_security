republican, and has no proper respect for kings; but the King of Italy was a
brother monarch, and might be induced to do the thing cheaper. So the letter was
written, and a prompt reply was received.
The Italian Government wrote that they would have pleasure in supplying
both a machine and an expert; and the whole cost would be 12,000 francs,
including travelling expenses. This was cheaper, but still it seemed too much.
The rascal was really not worth the money. It would still mean nearly two francs
more per head on the taxes. Another Council was called. They discussed and
considered how it could be done with less expense. Could not one of the soldiers
perhaps be got to do it in a rough and homely fashion? The General was called
and was asked: 'Can't you find us a soldier who would cut the man's head off? In
war they don't mind killing people. In fact, that is what they are trained for.' So
the General talked it over with the soldiers to see whether one of them would not
undertake the job. But none of the soldiers would do it. 'No,' they said, 'we don't
know how to do it; it is not a thing we have been taught.'
What was to be done? Again the Ministers considered and reconsidered.
They assembled a Commission, and a Committee, and a Sub-Committee, and at
last they decided that the best thing would be to alter the death sentence to one
of imprisonment for life. This would enable the King to show his mercy, and it
would come cheaper.

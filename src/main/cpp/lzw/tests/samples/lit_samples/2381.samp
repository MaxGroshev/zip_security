'O sheaf! my slave
This order gave:
Where a straw has been
Let a soldier be seen!'
And the sheaf fell asunder and became so many soldiers. The drums and
trumpets began to play. Iván ordered the soldiers to play and sing. He led them
out into the street, and the people were amazed, The soldiers played and sang,
and then Iván (forbidding any one to follow him) led them back to the thrashing
ground, changed them into a sheaf again, and threw it in its place.
He then went home and lay down in the stables to sleep.

Simon the Soldier heard of all these things next morning, and went to his
brother.
'Tell me,' says he, 'where you got those soldiers from, and where you have
taken them to?'
'What does it matter to you?' said Iván.
'What does it matter? Why, with soldiers one can do anything. One can
win a kingdom.'
Iván wondered.

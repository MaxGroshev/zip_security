     (The libretto of the opera, which was  written and first performed more
than  forty  years  after  Pushkin's  death,  is by  Chaykovsky  himself and
Konstantin Shilovsky, a minor  poet of the time.  It  is  nominally based on
Pushkin's text, but in fact the relationship is not very close.)
     Anyway, it should  be possible now, with  the help of Nabokov's literal
translation and commentary, to produce a reasonably accurate rhyming version
of  Pushkin's  work  which   can  at  least  be   read  with   pleasure  and
entertainment, and which,  ideally,  might even be able to stand on  its own
feet as English. That, in all humility, is the aim of the present text.

     Acknowledgements are  due  to  Messrs. Routledge  and  Kegan  Paul  for
permission to quote from Vladimir Nabokov's notes in volumes 2 and 3 of  his
edition of Eugene Onegin (London, 1964. Revised edition, 1976).
     I  am much  indebted  to  my  friends Sir Sacheverell Sitwell, for  his
interest  and  support,  and  Sir  John  Balfour,  for  his   searching  and
constructive criticism of the  translation;  to  Professor  Gleb Struve, for
generously  giving me the benefit of his unrivalled scholarship and insight;
above all, to my wife Natasha, for her loving encouragement.

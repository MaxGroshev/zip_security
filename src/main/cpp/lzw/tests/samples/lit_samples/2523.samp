of the heavens; such lamps as the sun, moon, and stars; or any figures to be
compared with living, loving, mutually-helpful men? Where are there any
records of God's goodness so easy to understand as the blessings which God has
strewn abroad for man's happiness? Where is there any book of the law so clear
to each man as that written in his heart? What sacrifices equal the self-denials
which loving men and women make for one another? And what altar can be
compared with the heart of a good man, on which God Himself accepts the
sacrifice?
'The higher a man's conception of God, the better will he know Him. And
the better he knows God, the nearer will he draw to Him, imitating His
goodness, His mercy, and His love of man.
'Therefore, let him who sees the sun's whole light filling the world, refrain
from blaming or despising the superstitious man, who in his own idol sees one
ray of that same light. Let him not despise even the unbeliever who is blind and
cannot see the sun at all.'
So spoke the Chinaman, the student of Confucius; and all who were
present in the coffee-house were silent, and disputed no more as to whose faith
was the best.

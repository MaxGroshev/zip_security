'No,' said he, 'It's clear I can't get away from here. How can I go, when I
have hardly strength to turn round?'
'Well, good-bye, then! Don't think ill of me!' and they kissed each other.
Zhílin seized the pole, told Dina to hold on, and began to climb. He slipped once
or twice; the shackles hindered him. Kostílin helped him, and he managed to get
to the top. Dina with her little hands, pulled with all her might at his shirt,
laughing.
Zhílin drew out the pole and said, 'Put it back in its place, Dina, or they'll
notice, and you will be beaten.'
She dragged the pole away, and Zhílin went down the hill. When he had
gone down the steep incline, he took a sharp stone and tried to wrench the lock
off the shackles. But it was a strong lock and he could not manage to break it, and
besides, it was difficult to get at. Then he heard some one running down the hill,
springing lightly. He thought: 'Surely, that's Dina again.'
Dina came, took a stone and said, 'Let me try.'
She knelt down and tried to wrench the lock off, but her little hands were
as slender as little twigs, and she had not the strength. She threw the stone away
and began to cry. Then Zhílin set to work again at the lock, and Dina squatted
beside him with her hand on his shoulder.

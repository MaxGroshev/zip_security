“I told you I did not know whether I should be here long ... that it depended on you....”

She had never anticipated that the utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her. But it lasted only an instant. She remembered Vronsky. She lifted her clear, truthful eyes, and seeing his desperate face, she answered hastily:

“That cannot be ... forgive me.”

“It was bound to be so,” he said, not looking at her.

He bowed, and was meaning to retreat.

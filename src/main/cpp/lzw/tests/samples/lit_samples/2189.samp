'From Vladímir. My family are of that town. My name is Makár, and they
also call me Semyónitch.'
Aksyónof raised his head and said: 'Tell me, Semyónitch, do you know
anything of the merchants Aksyónof, of Vladímir? Are they still alive?'
'Know them? Of course I do. The Aksyónofs are rich, though their father is
in Siberia: a sinner like ourselves, it seems! As for you, Gran'dad, how did you
come here?'
Aksyónof did not like to speak of his misfortune. He only sighed, and
said, 'For my sins I have been in prison these twenty-six years.'
'What sins?' asked Makár Semyónitch.
But Aksyónof only said, 'Well, well -- I must have deserved it!' He would
have said no more, but his companions told the new-comer how Aksyónof came
to be in Siberia: how some one had killed a merchant and had put a knife among
Aksyónof's things, and Aksyónof had been unjustly condemned.
When Makár Semyónitch heard this, he looked at Aksyónof, slapped his
own knee, and exclaimed, 'Well this is wonderful! Really wonderful! But how old
you've grown, Gran'dad!'
The others asked him why he was so surprised, and where he had seen
Aksyónof before; but Makár Semyónitch did not reply. He only said: 'It's
wonderful that we should meet here, lads!'

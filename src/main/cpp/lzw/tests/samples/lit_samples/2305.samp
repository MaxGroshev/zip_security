'Friends! . . . What is this? . . . One need only have pulled it out!'
In the morning the village Elder's son came to fetch Iván.
'Daddy Iván, your father is dying! He has sent for you to say good-bye.'
Iván had forgotten about his father, and did not understand what was
being said to him.
'What father?' he said. 'Whom has he sent for?'
'He sent for you, to say good-bye; he is dying in our cottage! Come along,
daddy Iván,' said the Elder's son, pulling him by the arm; and Iván followed the
lad.
When he was being carried out of the hut, some burning straw had fallen
on to the old man and burnt him, and he had been taken to the village Elder's in
the farther part of the village, which the fire did not reach.
When Iván came to his father, there was only the Elder's wife in the hut,
besides some little children on the top of the oven. All the rest were still at the
fire. The old man, who was lying on a bench holding a wax candle10 in his hand,
kept turning his eyes towards the door. When his son entered, he moved a little.
The old woman went up to him and told him that his son had come. He asked to
have him brought nearer. Iván came closer.
'What did I tell you, Iván?' began the old man 'Who has burnt down the
village?'

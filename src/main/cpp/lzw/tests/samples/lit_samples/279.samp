Chapter XXII
The Captain and the head of the village rode away, and Olénin, to please Lukáshka as well as to avoid going back alone through the dark forest, asked the corporal to give Lukáshka leave, and the corporal did so. Olénin thought that Lukáshka wanted to see Maryánka and he was also glad of the companionship of such a pleasant-looking and sociable Cossack. Lukáshka and Maryánka he involuntarily united in his mind, and he found pleasure in thinking about them. “He loves Maryánka,” thought Olénin, “and I could love her,” and a new and powerful emotion of tenderness overcame him as they walked homewards together through the dark forest. Lukáshka too felt happy; something akin to love made itself felt between these two very different young men. Every time they glanced at one another they wanted to laugh.

“By which gate do you enter?” asked Olénin.

“By the middle one. But I’ll see you as far as the marsh. After that you have nothing to fear.”

Olénin laughed.

“Do you think I am afraid? Go back, and thank you. I can get on alone.”

“It’s all right! What have I to do? And how can you help being afraid? Even we are afraid,” said Lukáshka to set Olénin’s self-esteem at rest, and he laughed too.

“Then come in with me. We’ll have a talk and a drink and in the morning you can go back.”

“Couldn’t I find a place to spend the night?” laughed Lukáshka. “But the corporal asked me to go back.”

“I heard you singing last night, and also saw you.”

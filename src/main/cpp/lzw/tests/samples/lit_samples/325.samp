“Well, and the girls in the sarafáns, did they make merry all by themselves?” asked Belétski.

“Yes, they did! Sometimes Cossacks would come on foot or on horse and say, ‘Let’s break up the khorovóds,’ and they’d go, but the girls would take up cudgels. Carnival week, some young fellow would come galloping up, and they’d cudgel his horse and cudgel him too. But he’d break through, seize the one he loved, and carry her off. And his sweetheart would love him to his heart’s content! Yes, the girls in those days, they were regular queens!”

Chapter XXXVI
Just then two men rode out of the side street into the square. One of them was Nazárka. The other, Lukáshka, sat slightly sideways on his well-fed bay Kabardá horse which stepped lightly over the hard road jerking its beautiful head with its fine glossy mane. The well-adjusted gun in its cover, the pistol at his back, and the cloak rolled up behind his saddle showed that Lukáshka had not come from a peaceful place or from one near by. The smart way in which he sat a little sideways on his horse, the careless motion with which he touched the horse under its belly with his whip, and especially his half-closed black eyes, glistening as he looked proudly around him, all expressed the conscious strength and self-confidence of youth. “Ever seen as fine a lad?” his eyes, looking from side to side, seemed to say. The elegant horse with its silver ornaments and trappings, the weapons, and the handsome Cossack himself attracted the attention of everyone in the square. Nazárka, lean and short, was much less well dressed. As he rode past the old men, Lukáshka paused and raised his curly white sheepskin cap above his closely cropped black head.

“Well, have you carried off many Nogáy horses?” asked a lean old man with a frowning, lowering look.

“Have you counted them, Grandad, that you ask?” replied Lukáshka, turning away.

“That’s all very well, but you need not take my lad along with you,” the old man muttered with a still darker frown.

“Just see the old devil, he knows everything,” muttered Lukáshka to himself, and a worried expression came over his face; but then, noticing a corner where a number of Cossack girls were standing, he turned his horse towards them.

“Good evening, girls!” he shouted in his powerful, resonant voice, suddenly checking his horse. “You’ve grown old without me, you witches!” and he laughed.

“Good evening, Lukáshka! Good evening, laddie!” the merry voices answered. “Have you brought much money? Buy some sweets for the girls!... Have you come for long? True enough, it’s long since we saw you....”

“Nazárka and I have just flown across to make a night of it,” replied Lukáshka, raising his whip and riding straight at the girls.

It was summer. At daybreak the baggage-train got ready under shelter of
the fortress; the soldiers marched out; and all started along the road. Zhílin was
on horseback, and a cart with his things went with the baggage-train. They had
sixteen miles to go. The baggage-train moved slowly; sometimes the soldiers
stopped, or perhaps a wheel would come off one of the carts, or a horse refuse to
go on, and then everybody had to wait.
When by the sun it was already past noon, they had not gone half the way.
It was dusty and hot, the sun was scorching and there was no shelter anywhere:
a bare plain all round -- not a tree, not a bush, by the road.
Zhílin rode on in front, and stopped, waiting for the baggage to overtake
him. Then he heard the signal-horn sounded behind him: the company had again
stopped. So he began to think: 'Hadn't I better ride on by myself? My horse is a
good one: if the Tartars do attack me, I can gallop away. Perhaps, however, it
would be wiser to wait.'
As he sat considering, Kostílin, an officer carrying a gun, rode up to him
and said:
'Come along, Zhílin, let's go on by ourselves. It's dreadful; I am famished,
and the heat is terrible. My shirt is wringing wet.'
Kostílin was a stout, heavy man, and the perspiration was running down
his red face. Zhílin thought awhile, and then asked: 'Is your gun loaded?'

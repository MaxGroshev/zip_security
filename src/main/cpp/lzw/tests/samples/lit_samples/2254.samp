Looking up, he saw something whitish behind the shrine. The daylight was
fading, and the shoemaker peered at the thing without being able to make out
what it was. 'There was no white stone here before. Can it be an ox? It's not like
an ox. It has a head like a man, but it's too white; and what could a man be doing
there?'
He came closer, so that it was clearly visible. To his surprise it really was a
man, alive or dead, sitting naked, leaning motionless against the shrine. Terror
seized the shoemaker, and he thought, 'Some one has killed him, stripped him,
and left him here. If I meddle I shall surely get into trouble.'
So the shoemaker went on. He passed in front of the shrine so that he
could not see the man. When he had gone some way, he looked back, and saw
that the man was no longer leaning against the shrine, but was moving as if
looking towards him. The shoemaker felt more frightened than before, and
thought, 'Shall I go back to him, or shall I go on? If I go near him something
dreadful may happen. Who knows who the fellow is? He has not come here for
any good. If I go near him he may jump up and throttle me, and there will be no
getting away. Or if not, he'd still be a burden on one's hands. What could I do
with a naked man? I couldn't give him my last clothes. Heaven only help me to
get away!'

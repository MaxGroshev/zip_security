'I shall be fifty next year,' said he, 'and have a married son, and have never

Ivan's heart grew heavy. He thought how he himself would feel if he were
sentenced, and he pitied Gabriel. Then he heard his old father up on the oven
cough, and saw him sit up, lower his legs, and scramble down. The old man
dragged himself slowly to a seat, and sat down. He was quite tired out with the
exertion, and coughed a long time till he had cleared his throat. Then, leaning
against the table, he said: 'Well, has he been condemned?'
'Yes, to twenty strokes with the rods,' answered Iván.

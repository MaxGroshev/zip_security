vanishing, as if the whole sky were on the move.
I found my comrade sleeping, but woke him up, and related how we had
got round the bear. After telling our peasant host to collect beaters for the
morning, we had supper and lay down to sleep.
I was so tired that I could have slept on till midday, if my comrade had
not roused me. I jumped up, and saw that he was already dressed, and busy
doing something to his gun.
'Where is Damian?' said I.
'In the forest, long ago. He has already been over the tracks you made, and
been back here, and now he has gone to look after the beaters.'
I washed and dressed, and loaded my guns; and then we got into a sledge,
and started.
The sharp frost still continued. It was quiet, and the sun could not be seen.
There was a thick mist above us, and hoar-frost still covered everything.
After driving about two miles along the road, as we came near the forest,
we saw a cloud of smoke rising from a hollow, and presently reached a group of
peasants, both men and women, armed with cudgels.
We got out and went up to them. The men sat roasting potatoes, and
laughing and talking with the women.

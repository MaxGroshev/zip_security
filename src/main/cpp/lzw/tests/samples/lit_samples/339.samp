“They’ll come directly,” replied Belétski. “Come along, we must prepare the ball.”

Chapter XXXIX
It was already late in the night when Olénin came out of Belétski’s hut following Maryánka and Ústenka. He saw in the dark street before him the gleam of the girl’s white kerchief. The golden moon was descending towards the steppe. A silvery mist hung over the village. All was still; there were no lights anywhere and one heard only the receding footsteps of the young women. Olénin’s heart beat fast. The fresh moist atmosphere cooled his burning face. He glanced at the sky and turned to look at the hut he had just come out of: the candle was already out. Then he again peered through the darkness at the girls’ retreating shadows. The white kerchief disappeared in the mist. He was afraid to remain alone, he was so happy. He jumped down from the porch and ran after the girls.

“Bother you, someone may see...” said Ústenka.

“Never mind!”

Olénin ran up to Maryánka and embraced her.

Maryánka did not resist.

“Haven’t you kissed enough yet?” said Ústenka. “Marry and then kiss, but now you’d better wait.”

“Good-night, Maryánka. Tomorrow I will come to see your father and tell him. Don’t you say anything.”

“Why should I!” answered Maryánka.

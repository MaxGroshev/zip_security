Matryóna noticed at once that her husband smelt of spirits. 'There now, he
has been drinking,' thought she. And when she saw that he was coatless, had
only her jacket on, brought no parcel, stood there silent, and seemed ashamed,
her heart was ready to break with disappointment. 'He has drunk the money,'
thought she, 'and has been on the spree with some good-for-nothing fellow
whom he has brought home with him.'
Matryóna let them pass into the hut, followed them in, and saw that the
stranger was a young, slight man, wearing her husband's coat. There was no shirt
to be seen under it, and he had no hat. Having entered, he stood neither moving,
nor raising his eyes, and Matryóna thought: 'He must be a bad man -- he's afraid.'

Matryóna frowned, and stood beside the oven looking to see what they
would do.
Simon took off his cap and sat down on the bench as if things were all
right.
'Come, Matryóna; if supper is ready, let us have some.'
Matryóna muttered something to herself and did not move, but stayed
where she was, by the oven. She looked first at the one and then at the other of
them, and only shook her head. Simon saw that his wife was annoyed, but tried
to pass it off. Pretending not to notice anything, he took the stranger by the arm.

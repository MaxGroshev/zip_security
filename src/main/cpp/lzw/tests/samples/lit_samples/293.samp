“What fiend brought me to this disgusting feast?” thought Olénin, rising to go away.

“Where are you off to?”

“I’ll fetch some tobacco,” he said, meaning to escape, but Belétski seized his hand.

“I have some money,” he said to him in French.

“One can’t go away, one has to pay here,” thought Olénin bitterly, vexed at his own awkwardness. “Can’t I really behave like Belétski? I ought not to have come, but once I am here I must not spoil their fun. I must drink like a Cossack,” and taking the wooden bowl (holding about eight tumblers) he almost filled it with chikhir and drank it almost all. The girls looked at him, surprised and almost frightened, as he drank. It seemed to them strange and not right. Ústenka brought them another glass each, and kissed them both. “There girls, now we’ll have some fun,” she said, clinking on the plate the four rubles the men had put there.

Olénin no longer felt awkward, but became talkative.

“Now, Maryánka, it’s your turn to offer us wine and a kiss,” said Belétski, seizing her hand.

“Yes, I’ll give you such a kiss!” she said playfully, preparing to strike at him.

“One can kiss Grandad without payment,” said another girl.

“There’s a sensible girl,” said Belétski, kissing the struggling girl. “No, you must offer it,” he insisted, addressing Maryánka. “Offer a glass to your lodger.”

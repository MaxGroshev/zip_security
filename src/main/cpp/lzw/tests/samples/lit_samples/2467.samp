selling bread; and we knew nothing of money. Each man had corn enough of his
own.'
'Then tell me, grandfather,' asked the King, 'where was your field, where
did you grow corn like this?'
And the grandfather answered:
'My field was God's earth. Wherever I ploughed, there was my field. Land
was free. It was a thing no man called his own. Labour was the only thing men
called their own.'
'Answer me two more questions,' said the King. 'The first is, Why did the
earth bear such grain then and has ceased to do so now? And the second is, Why
your grandson walks with two crutches, your son with one, and you yourself
with none? Your eyes are bright, your teeth sound, and your speech clear and
pleasant to the ear. How have these things come about?'
And the old man answered:
'These things are so, because men have ceased to live by their own labour,
and have taken to depending on the labour of others. In the old time, men lived
according to God's law. They had what was their own, and coveted not what
others had produced.

Maryánka raised herself, and after thinking a moment, smiled.

“Do you know what he once told me: the lodger I mean?” she said, biting a bit of grass. “He said, ‘I’d like to be Lukáshka the Cossack, or your brother Lazútka—.’ What do you think he meant?”

“Oh, just chattering what came into his head,” answered Ústenka. “What does mine not say! Just as if he was possessed!”

Maryánka dropped her hand on her folded beshmet, threw her arm over Ústenka’s shoulder, and shut her eyes.

“He wanted to come and work in the vineyard today: father invited him,” she said, and after a short silence she fell asleep.

She nudged Ústenka and smilingly pointed him out to her.

“Ah, you should go out there in that direction, go right as by compasses, there in a disused vineyard denominated as the Waste, hares are always to be found,” said the cornet, having at once changed his manner of speech.

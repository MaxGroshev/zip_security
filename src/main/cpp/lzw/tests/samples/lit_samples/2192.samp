Aksyónof trembled with anger as he looked at his enemy. He drew his
hand away, saying, 'I have no wish to escape, and you have no need to kill me;
you killed me long ago! As to telling of you -- I may do so or not, as God shall
direct.'
Next day, when the convicts were led out to work, the convoy soldiers
noticed that one or other of the prisoners emptied some earth out of his boots.
The prison was searched, and the tunnel found. The Governor came and
questioned all the prisoners to find out who had dug the hole. They all denied
any knowledge of it. Those who knew, would not betray Makár Semyónitch,
knowing he would be flogged almost to death. At last the Governor turned to
Aksyónof, whom he knew to be a just man, and said:
'You are a truthful old man; tell me, before God, who dug the hole?'
Makár Semyónitch stood as if he were quite unconcerned, looking at the
Governor and not so much as glancing at Aksyónof. Aksyónof's lips and hands
trembled, and for a long time he could not utter a word. He thought, 'Why
should I screen him who ruined my life? Let him pay for what I have suffered.
But if I tell, they will probably flog the life out of him and maybe I suspect him
wrongly. And, after all, what good would it be to me?'
'Well, old man,' repeated the Governor, 'tell us the truth: who has been
digging under the wall?'

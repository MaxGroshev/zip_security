“Uncle! Hallo, Uncle!” called out Lukáshka sharply from above, attracting everybody’s attention. All the Cossacks looked up at him. “Just go to the upper water-course, there’s a fine herd of boars there. I’m not inventing, really! The other day one of our Cossacks shot one there. I’m telling you the truth,” added he, readjusting the musket at his back and in a tone that showed he was not joking.

“Ah! Lukáshka the Snatcher is here!” said the old man, looking up. “Where has he been shooting?”

“Haven’t you seen? I suppose you’re too young!” said Lukáshka. “Close by the ditch,” he went on seriously with a shake of the head. “We were just going along the ditch when all at once we heard something crackling, but my gun was in its case. Elias fired suddenly ... But I’ll show you the place, it’s not far. You just wait a bit. I know every one of their footpaths ... Daddy Mósev,” said he, turning resolutely and almost commandingly to the corporal, “it’s time to relieve guard!” and holding aloft his gun he began to descend from the watch-tower without waiting for the order.

“Come down!” said the corporal, after Lukáshka had started, and glanced round. “Is it your turn, Gúrka? Then go ... True enough your Lukáshka has become very skilful,” he went on, addressing the old man. “He keeps going about just like you, he doesn’t stay at home. The other day he killed a boar.”

Chapter VII
The sun had already set and the shades of night were rapidly spreading from the edge of the wood. The Cossacks finished their task round the cordon and gathered in the hut for supper. Only the old man still stayed under the plane tree watching for the vulture and pulling the string tied to the falcon’s leg, but though a vulture was really perching on the plane tree it declined to swoop down on the lure. Lukáshka, singing one song after another, was leisurely placing nets among the very thickest brambles to trap pheasants. In spite of his tall stature and big hands every kind of work, both rough and delicate, prospered under Lukáshka’s fingers.

“Hallo, Luke!” came Nazárka’s shrill, sharp voice calling him from the thicket close by. “The Cossacks have gone in to supper.”

Nazárka, with a live pheasant under his arm, forced his way through the brambles and emerged on the footpath.

“Oh!” said Lukáshka, breaking off in his song, “where did you get that cock pheasant? I suppose it was in my trap?”

Nazárka was of the same age as Lukáshka and had also only been at the front since the previous spring.

He was plain, thin and puny, with a shrill voice that rang in one’s ears. They were neighbours and comrades. Lukáshka was sitting on the grass cross-legged like a Tartar, adjusting his nets.

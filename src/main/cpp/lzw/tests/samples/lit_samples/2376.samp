Iván returned home, and there was his other brother, Tarás with his wife,
sitting at supper.
Taras the Stout had failed to pay his debts, had run away from his
creditors, and had come home to his father's house. When he saw Iván, 'Look
here', said he, 'till I can start in business again, I want you to keep me and my
wife.'
'All right,' said Iván, 'you can live here, if you like.'
Iván took off his coat and sat down to table, but the merchant's wife said:
'I cannot sit at table with this clown, he smells of perspiration.'
Then Tarás the Stout said, 'Iván, you smell too strong. Go and eat outside.'
'All right,' said Iván, taking some bread and going into the yard. 'It is time,
anyhow, for me to go and pasture the mare.'

Tarás's imp, being also free that night, came, as agreed, to help his
comrades subdue Iván the Fool. He came to the cornfield, looked and looked for
his comrades -- no one was there. He only found a hole. He went to the meadow,
and there he found an imp's tail in the swamp, and another hole in the rye
stubble.
'Evidently, some ill-luck has befallen my comrades,' thought he. 'I must
take their place and tackle the fool.'

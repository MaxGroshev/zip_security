Lukáshka was the first to break the silence.

“Have you a house of your own in Russia?” he asked.

Olénin could not refrain from replying that he had not only one, but several houses.

“A good house? Bigger than ours?” asked Lukáshka good-naturedly.

“Much bigger; ten times as big and three storeys high,” replied Olénin.

“And have you horses such as ours?”

“I have a hundred horses, worth three or four hundred rubles each, but they are not like yours. They are trotters, you know.... But still, I like the horses here best.”

“Well, and did you come here of your own free will, or were you sent?” said Lukáshka, laughing at him. “Look! that’s where you lost your way,” he added, “you should have turned to the right.”

“I came by my own wish,” replied Olénin. “I wanted to see your parts and to join some expeditions.”

“I would go on an expedition any day,” said Lukáshka. “D’you hear the jackals howling?” he added, listening.

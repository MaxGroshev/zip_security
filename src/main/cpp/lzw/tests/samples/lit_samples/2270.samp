Michael.
'Whom have you there?' asked he
'That is my workman. He will sew the boots.'
'Mind,' said the gentleman to Michael, 'remember to make them so that
they will last me a year.'
Simon also looked at Michael, and saw that Michael was not looking at the
gentleman, but was gazing into the corner behind the gentleman, as if he saw
some one there. Michael looked and looked, and suddenly he smiled, and his
face became brighter.
'What are you grinning at, you fool?' thundered the gentleman. 'You had
better look to it that the boots are ready in time.'
'They shall be ready in good time,' said Michael.
'Mind it is so,' said the gentleman, and he put on his boots and his fur coat,
wrapped the latter round him, and went to the door. But he forgot to stoop and
struck his head against the lintel.
He swore and rubbed his head. Then he took his seat in the carriage and
drove away.
When he had gone, Simon said: 'There's a figure of a man for you! You
could not kill him with a mallet. He almost knocked out the lintel, but little harm
it did him.'

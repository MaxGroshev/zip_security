'What pleases me best here,' answered Pahóm 'is your land. Our land is
crowded, and the soil is exhausted; but you have plenty of land and it is good
land. I never saw the like of it.'
21Five kopeks for a desyatina. 22Kibitkas, as described in footnote 18.

The interpreter translated. The Bashkírs talked among themselves for a
while. Pahóm could not understand what they were saying, but saw that they
were much amused, and that they shouted and laughed. Then they were silent
and looked at Pahóm while the interpreter said:
'They wish me to tell you that in return for your presents they will gladly
give you as much land as you want. You have only to point it out with your hand
and it is yours.'
The Bashkírs talked again for a while and began to dispute. Pahóm asked
what they were disputing about, and the interpreter told him that some of them
thought they ought to ask their Chief about the land and not act in his absence,
while others thought there was no need to wait for his return.

While the Bashkírs were disputing, a man in a large fox-fur cap appeared
on the scene. They all became silent and rose to their feet. The interpreter said,
'This is our Chief himself.'

orders. They began to burn houses and corn, and to kill cattle. But the fools still
offered no resistance, and only wept. The old men wept, and the old women
wept, and the young people wept.
'Why do you harm us?' they said. 'Why do you waste good things? If you
need them, why do you not take them for yourselves?'
At last the soldiers could stand it no longer. They refused to go any
further, and the army disbanded and fled.

The old Devil had to give it up. He could not get the better of Iván with
soldiers. So he changed himself into a fine gentleman, and settled down in Ivan's
kingdom. He meant to overcome him by means of money, as he had overcome
Tarás the Stout.
'I wish,' says he, 'to do you a good turn, to teach you sense and reason. I
will build a house among you and organize a trade.'
'All right,' said Iván, 'come and live among us if you like.'
Next morning the fine gentleman went out into the public square with a
big sack of gold and a sheet of paper, and said, 'You all live like swine. I wish to
teach you how to live properly. Build me a house according to this plan. You
shall work, I will tell you how, and I will pay you with gold coins.' And he
showed them the gold.

He thought all this, and was about to go to bed, but was loth to leave his
book. So he went on reading the seventh chapter -- about the centurion, the
widow's son, and the answer to John's disciples -- and he came to the part where
a rich Pharisee invited the Lord to his house; and he read how the woman who
was a sinner, anointed his feet and washed them with her tears, and how he
justified her. Coming to the forty-fourth verse, he read:
'And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I
entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath
wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair. Thou gavest me no
kiss; but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head
with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.'
He read these verses and thought: 'He gave no water for his feet, gave no
kiss, his head with oil he did not anoint. . . .' And Martin took off his spectacles
once more, laid them on his book, and pondered.
'He must have been like me, that Pharisee. He too thought only of himself
-- how to get a cup of tea, how to keep warm and comfortable; never a thought of
his guest. He took care of himself, but for his guest he cared nothing at all. Yet
who was the guest? The Lord himself! If he came to me, should I behave like
that?'

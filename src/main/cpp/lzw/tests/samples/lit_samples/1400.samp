“If this patience comes out,” he said to himself after shuffling the cards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, “if it comes out, it means... what does it mean?”

He had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.

“Then it will mean that I must go to the army,” said Pierre to himself. “Come in, come in!” he added to the princess.

Only the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long waist, was still living in Pierre’s house. The two younger ones had both married.

“Excuse my coming to you, cousin,” she said in a reproachful and agitated voice. “You know some decision must be come to. What is going to happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is it that we are staying on?”

“On the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine,” said Pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.

“Satisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Ivánovna told me today how our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly does them credit! And the people too are quite mutinous—they no longer obey, even my maid has taken to being rude. At this rate they will soon begin beating us. One can’t walk in the streets. But, above all, the French will be here any day now, so what are we waiting for? I ask just one thing of you, cousin,” she went on, “arrange for me to be taken to Petersburg. Whatever I may be, I can’t live under Bonaparte’s rule.”

“Oh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On the contrary...”

“I won’t submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If you don’t want to do this...”

“But I will, I’ll give the order at once.”

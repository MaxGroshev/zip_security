And people came to Iván to be tried. One said. 'He stole my money.' And
Iván said, 'All right, that shows that he wanted it.'
And they all got to know that Iván was a fool. And his wife said to him,
'People say that you are a fool.'
'All right,' said Iván.
His wife thought and thought about it, but she also was a fool.
'Shall I go against my husband? Where the needle goes the thread follows,'
said she.
So she took off her royal dress, put it away in a chest, and went to the
dumb girl to learn to work. And she learned to work and began to help her
husband.
And all the wise men left Iván's kingdom; only the fools remained.
Nobody had money. They lived and worked. They fed themselves; and
they fed others.
The old Devil waited and waited for news from the imps of their having
ruined the three brothers. But no news came. So he went himself to inquire about
99
it. He searched and searched, but instead of finding the three imps he found only
the three holes.
'Evidently they have failed,' thought he. 'I shall have to tackle it myself.'

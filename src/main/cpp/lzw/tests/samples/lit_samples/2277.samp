later on we will arrange what to do for them." So I nursed the sound one at my
breast, but at first I did not feed this crippled one. I did not suppose she would

her, and began to feed her. And so I fed my own boy and these two -- the three of
them -- at my own breast. I was young and strong, and had good food, and God
gave me so much milk that at times it even overflowed. I used sometimes to feed
two at a time, while the third was waiting. When one had had enough I nursed
the third. And God so ordered it that these grew up, while my own was buried
before he was two years old. And I had no more children, though we prospered.

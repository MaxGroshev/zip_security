'Sit down, friend,' said he, 'and let us have some supper.'
The stranger sat down on the bench.
'Haven't you cooked anything for us?' said Simon.
Matryóna's anger boiled over. 'I've cooked, but not for you. It seems to me
you have drunk your wits away. You went to buy a sheep-skin coat, but come
home without so much as the coat you had on, and bring a naked vagabond
home with you. I have no supper for drunkards like you.'
'That's enough, Matryóna. Don't wag your tongue without reason! You
had better ask what sort of man --'
'And you tell me what you've done with the money?'
Simon found the pocket of the jacket, drew out the three-rouble note, and
unfolded it.
'Here is the money. Trífonof did not pay, but promises to pay soon.'
Matryóna got still more angry; he had bought no sheep-skins, but had put
his only coat on some naked fellow and had even brought him to their house.
She snatched up the note from the table, took it to put away in safety, and
said: 'I have no supper for you. We can't feed all the naked drunkards in the
world.'
'There now, Matryóna, hold your tongue a bit. First hear what a man has
to say!'

     so that all three went off to lunch,
     then later slyly he'd revile them
     with lies and jokes that packed a punch:

     beneath bird-cherries and acacias
     has found a port for his old age,
     and lives, a veritable sage,
     for planting cabbage, like Horatius,
     and breeding ducks and geese as well,
     and teaching children how to spell.

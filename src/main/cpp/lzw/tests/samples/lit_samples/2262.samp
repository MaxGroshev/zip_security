naked. Why, he hasn't even a shirt on him. If he were all right, you would say
where you came across the fellow.'
'That's just what I am trying to tell you,' said Simon. 'As I came to the
shrine I saw him sitting all naked and frozen. It isn't quite the weather to sit
about naked! God sent me to him, or he would have perished. What was I to do?
How do we know what may have happened to him? So I took him, clothed him,
and brought him along. Don't be so angry, Matryóna. It is a sin. Remember, we
all must die one day.'
Angry words rose to Matryóna's lips, but she looked at the stranger and
was silent. He sat on the edge of the bench, motionless, his hands folded on his
knees, his head drooping on his breast, his eyes closed, and his brows knit as if in
pain. Matryóna was silent, and Simon said: 'Matryóna, have you no love of God?'
Matryóna heard these words, and as she looked at the stranger, suddenly
her heart softened towards him. She came back from the door, and going to the
oven she got out the supper. Setting a cup on the table, she poured out some
kvas7. Then she brought out the last piece of bread, and set out a knife and
spoons.
'Eat, if you want to,' said she.
Simon drew the stranger to the table.
'Take your place, young man,' said he.

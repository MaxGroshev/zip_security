“There now! In common! And what have I in common with Amália Ivánovna? It’s the same thing! You may say they’re not very clean—that’s another matter... À la guerre, comme à la guerre!...”

“But I have never known any Amália Ivánovas, and have never known how to behave with women of that sort,” replied Olénin. “One cannot respect them, but these I do respect.”

“Well go on respecting them! Who wants to prevent you?”

Olénin did not reply. He evidently wanted to complete what he had begun to say. It was very near his heart.

“I know I am an exception...” He was visibly confused. “But my life has so shaped itself that I not only see no necessity to renounce my rules, but I could not live here, let alone live as happily as I am doing, were I to live as you do. Therefore I look for something quite different from what you look for.”

Belétski raised his eyebrows incredulously. “Anyhow, come to me this evening; Maryánka will be there and I will make you acquainted. Do come, please! If you feel dull you can go away. Will you come?”

“I would come, but to speak frankly I am afraid of being seriously carried away.”

“Oh, oh, oh!” shouted Belétski. “Only come, and I’ll see that you aren’t. Will you? On your word?”

“I would come, but really I don’t understand what we shall do; what part we shall play!”

“Please, I beg of you. You will come?”

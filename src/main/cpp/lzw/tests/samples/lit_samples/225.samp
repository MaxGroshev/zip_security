Chapter VIII
It was quite dark when Uncle Eróshka and the three Cossacks, in their cloaks and shouldering their guns, left the cordon and went towards the place on the Térek where they were to lie in ambush. Nazárka did not want to go at all, but Lukáshka shouted at him and they soon started. After they had gone a few steps in silence the Cossacks turned aside from the ditch and went along a path almost hidden by reeds till they reached the river. On its bank lay a thick black log cast up by the water. The reeds around it had been recently beaten down.

“Shall we lie here?” asked Nazárka.

“Why not?” answered Lukáshka. “Sit down here and I’ll be back in a minute. I’ll only show Daddy where to go.”

“This is the best place; here we can see and not be seen,” said Ergushóv, “so it’s here we’ll lie. It’s a first-rate place!”

Nazárka and Ergushóv spread out their cloaks and settled down behind the log, while Lukáshka went on with Uncle Eróshka.

“It’s not far from here. Daddy,” said Lukáshka, stepping softly in front of the old man; “I’ll show you where they’ve been—I’m the only one that knows, Daddy.”

“Show me! You’re a fine fellow, a regular Snatcher!” replied the old man, also whispering.

Having gone a few steps Lukáshka stopped, stooped down over a puddle, and whistled. “That’s where they come to drink, d’you see?” He spoke in a scarcely audible voice, pointing to fresh hoof-prints.

“Christ bless you,” answered the old man. “The boar will be in the hollow beyond the ditch,” he added. “I’ll watch, and you can go.”

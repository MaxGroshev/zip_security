AND OF HIS TWO BROTHERS, SIMON THE SOLDIER AND TARÁS
THE STOUT; AND OF HIS DUMB SISTER MARTHA, AND OF THE OLD
DEVIL AND THE THREE LITTLE IMPS.
ONCE upon a time, in a certain province of a certain country, there lived a rich
peasant, who had three sons: Simon the Soldier, Tarás the Stout, and Iván the
Fool, besides an unmarried daughter, Martha, who was deaf and dumb. Simon
the Soldier went to the wars to serve the king; Tarás the Stout went to a
merchant's in town to trade, and Iván the Fool stayed at home with the lass, to till
the ground till his back bent.
Simon the Soldier obtained high rank and an estate, and married a
nobleman's daughter. His pay was large and his estate was large, but yet he
could not make ends meet. What the husband earned his lady wife squandered,
and they never had money enough.
So Simon the Soldier went to his estate to collect the income, but his
steward said, 'where is any income to come from? We have neither cattle, nor
tools, nor horse, nor plough, nor harrow. We must first get all these, and then the
money will come.'
Then Simon the Soldier went to his father and said: 'You, father, are rich,
but have given me nothing. Divide what you have, and give me a third part, that
I may improve my estate.'

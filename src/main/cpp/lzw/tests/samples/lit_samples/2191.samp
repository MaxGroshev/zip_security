the executioner, and the people standing around; the chains, the convicts, all the
twenty-six years of his prison life, and his premature old age. The thought of it
all made him so wretched that he was ready to kill himself.
'And it's all that villain's doing!' thought Aksyónof. And his anger was so
great against Makár Semyónitch that he longed for vengeance, even if he himself
should perish for it. He kept repeating prayers all night, but could get no peace.
During the day he did not go near Makár Semyónitch, nor even look at him.

A fortnight passed in this way. Aksyónof could not sleep at nights, and
was so miserable that he did not know what to do.
One night as he was walking about the prison he noticed some earth that
came rolling out from under one of the shelves on which the prisoners slept. He
stopped to see what it was. Suddenly Makár Semyónitch crept out from under
the shelf, and looked up at Aksyónof with frightened face. Aksyónof tried to pass
without looking at him, but Makár seized his hand and told him that he had dug
a hole under the wall, getting rid of the earth by putting it into his high-boots,
and emptying it out every day on the road when the prisoners were driven to
their work.
'Just you keep quiet, old man, and you shall get out too. If you blab they'll
flog the life out of me, but I will kill you first.'

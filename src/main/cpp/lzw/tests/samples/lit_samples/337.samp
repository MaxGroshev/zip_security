Ústenka tore herself away, and swinging her arm gave him such a blow on the back that she hurt her hand.

“Well, are you going to have another turn?” he asked.

“The other girls may if they like,” answered Ústenka, “but I am going home and Maryánka was coming to our house too.”

With his arm still round her, Lukáshka led Maryánka away from the crowd to the darker corner of a house.

“Don’t go, Maryánka,” he said, “let’s have some fun for the last time. Go home and I will come to you!”

“What am I to do at home? Holidays are meant for merrymaking. I am going to Ústenka’s,” replied Maryánka.

“I’ll marry you all the same, you know!”

“All right,” said Maryánka, “we shall see when the time comes.”

“So you are going,” said Lukáshka sternly, and, pressing her close, he kissed her on the cheek.

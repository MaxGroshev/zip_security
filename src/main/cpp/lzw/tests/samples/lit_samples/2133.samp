     of oligarchical converse,
     pride's icy calm, the combination
     of ranks and ages so diverse.
     But who stands there, in this selected
     assembly, silent and dejected?

     Faces before him flash and change
     like irksome phantoms, null as zero.

     torment of pride? And why's he come?
     Who on earth is he? not... our hero?
     No doubt about it, it's Eugene.

     does he still pose, and play the freak?
     Now he's returned, what role's he dancing?

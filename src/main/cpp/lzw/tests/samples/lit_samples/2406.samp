provide himself with bread.
The old Devil stood on the top of the tower yet another day, talking away.
People came near, looked on for awhile, and then went away.
And Iván asked, 'Well, has the gentleman begun to work with his head
yet?'
'Not yet,' said the people; 'he's still spouting away.'
The old Devil stood on the tower one day more, but he began to grow
weak, so that he staggered and hit his head against one of the pillars of the
lantern. One of the people noticed it and told Ivan's wife, and she ran to her
husband, who was in the field.
'Come and look,' said she. 'They say the gentleman is beginning to work
with his head.'
Iván was surprised.
'Really?' says he, and he turned his horse round, and went to the tower.
And by the time he reached the tower the old Devil was quite exhausted with
hunger, and was staggering and knocking his head against the pillars. And just
as Iván arrived at the tower, the Devil stumbled, fell, and came bump, bump,
bump, straight down the stairs to the bottom, counting each step with a knock of
his head!

'Your belief in your Roman religion is vain,' said he. 'It was superseded
twelve hundred years ago by the true faith: that of Mohammed! You cannot but
observe how the true Mohammedan faith continues to spread both in Europe
and Asia, and even in the enlightened country of China. You say yourselves that
God has rejected the Jews; and, as a proof, you quote the fact that the Jews are
humiliated and their faith does not spread. Confess then the truth of
Mohammedanism, for it is triumphant and spreads far and wide. None will be
saved but the followers of Mohammed, God's latest prophet; and of them, only
the followers of Omar, and not of Ali, for the latter are false to the faith.'
To this the Persian theologian, who was of the sect of Ali, wished to reply;
but by this time a great dispute had arisen among all the strangers of different
faiths and creeds present. There were Abyssinian Christians, Llamas from Thibet,
Ismailians and Fire-worshippers. They all argued about the nature of God, and
how He should be worshipped. Each of them asserted that in his country alone
was the true God known and rightly worshipped.
Every one argued and shouted, except a Chinaman, a student of
Confucius, who sat quietly in one corner of the coffee-house, not joining in the
dispute. He sat there drinking tea and listening to what the others said, but did
not speak himself.

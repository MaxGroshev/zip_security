rode away to the hills.
So there sat Zhílin, swaying from side to side, his head striking against the
Tartar's stinking back. He could see nothing but that muscular back and sinewy
neck, with its closely shaven, bluish nape. Zhílin's head was wounded: the blood
had dried over his eyes, and he could neither shift his position on the saddle nor
wipe the blood off. His arms were bound so tightly that his collar-bones ached.
They rode up and down hills for a long way. Then they reached a river
which they forded, and came to a hard road leading across a valley.
Zhílin tried to see where they were going, but his eyelids were stuck
together with blood, and he could not turn.
Twilight began to fall; they crossed another river and rode up a stony
hillside. There was a smell of smoke here, and dogs were barking. They had
reached an Aoul (a Tartar village). The Tartars got off their horses; Tartar
children came and stood round Zhílin, shrieking with pleasure and throwing
stones at him.
The Tartar drove the children away, took Zhílin off the horse, and called
his man. A Nogáy5 with high cheek-bones, and nothing on but a shirt (and that
so torn that his breast was all bare), answered the call. The Tartar gave him an
order. He went and fetched shackles: two blocks of oak with iron rings attached,
and a clasp and lock fixed to one of the rings.

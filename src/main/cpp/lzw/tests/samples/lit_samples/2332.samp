indorsed. Then, after dinner, Efím visited the Holy Places with his companion,
the pilgrim. It was not the time when they could be admitted to the Holy
Sepulchre, but they went to the Patriarchate. All the pilgrims assembled there.
The women were separated from the men, who were all told to sit in a circle,
barefoot. Then a monk came in with a towel to wash their feet. He washed,
wiped, and then kissed their feet, and did this to every one in the circle. Efím's
feet were washed and kissed, with the rest. He stood through vespers and
matins, prayed, placed candles at the shrines, handed in booklets inscribed with
his parents, names, that they might be mentioned in the church prayers. Here at
the Patriarchate food and wine were given them. Next morning they went to the
cell of Mary of Egypt, where she had lived doing penance. Here too they placed
candles and had prayers read. From there they went to Abraham's Monastery,
and saw the place where Abraham intended to slay his son as an offering to God.
Then they visited the spot where Christ appeared to Mary Magdalene, and the
Church of James, the Lord's brother. The pilgrim showed Efím all these places,
and told him how much money to give at each place. At mid-day they returned
to the inn and had dinner. As they were preparing to lie down and rest, the
pilgrim cried out, and began to search his clothes, feeling them all over.
'My purse has been stolen, there were twenty-three roubles in it,' said he,
'two ten-rouble notes and the rest in change.'

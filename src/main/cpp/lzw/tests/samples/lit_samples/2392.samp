he manufactured large quantities of improved rifles and cannons. Then he made
haste to declare war against a neighbouring king. As soon as he met the other
army, King Simon ordered his soldiers to rain balls against it and shoot fire from
the cannons, and at one blow he burned and crippled half the enemy's army. The
neighbouring king was so thoroughly frightened that he gave way and
surrendered his kingdom. King Simon was delighted.
'Now,' said he, 'I will conquer the King of India.'
But the Indian King had heard about King Simon and had adopted all his
inventions, and added more of his own. The Indian King enlisted not only all the
young men, but all the single women also, and got together a greater army even
than King Simon's. And he copied all King Simon's rifles and cannons, and
invented a way of flying through the air to throw explosive bombs from above.
King Simon set out to fight the Indian King, expecting to beat him as he
had beaten the other king; but the scythe that had cut so well had lost its edge.
The King of India did not let Simon's army come within gunshot, but sent his
women through the air to hurl down explosive bombs on to Simon's army. The
women began to rain down bombs on to the army like borax upon cockroaches.
The army ran away, and Simon the King was left alone. So the Indian King took
Simon's kingdom, and Simon the Soldier fled as best he might.
Having finished with this brother, the old Devil went to King Tarás.

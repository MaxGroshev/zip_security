given him. Pahóm had a talk with this peasant and asked him where he came
from. The stranger answered that he came from beyond the Volga, where he had
been working. One word led to another, and the man went on to say that many
people were settling in those parts. He told how some people from his village
had settled there. They had joined the Commune, and had had twenty-five acres
per man granted them. The land was so good, he said, that the rye sown on it
grew as high as a horse, and so thick that five cuts of a sickle made a sheaf. One
peasant, he said, had brought nothing with him but his bare hands, and now he
had six horses and two cows of his own.
Pahóm's heart kindled with desire. He thought:
'Why should I suffer in this narrow hole, if one can live so well elsewhere?
I will sell my land and my homestead here, and with the money I will start afresh
over there and get everything new. In this crowded place one is always having
trouble. But I must first go and find out all about it myself.
Towards summer he got ready and started. He went down the Volga on a
steamer to Samára, then walked another three hundred miles on foot, and at last
reached the place. It was just as the stranger had said. The peasants had plenty of
land: every man had twenty-five acres of Communal land given him for his use,
and any one who had money could buy, besides, at two shillings an acre20 as
much good freehold land as he wanted.

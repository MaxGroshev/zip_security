So the imp went to look for Iván, who had already stacked the corn and
was cutting trees in the wood. The two brothers had begun to feel crowded,
93
living together, and had told Iván to cut down trees to build new houses for
them.
The imp ran to the wood, climbed among the branches, and began to
hinder Iván from felling the trees. Iván undercut one tree so that it should fall
clear, but in falling it turned askew and caught among some branches. Iván cut a
pole with which to lever it aside, and with difficulty contrived to bring it to the
ground. He set to work to fell another tree -- again the same thing occurred; and
with all his efforts he could hardly get the tree clear. He began on a third tree,
and again the same thing happened.
Iván had hoped to cut down half a hundred small trees, but had not felled
even half a score, and now the night was come and he was tired out. The steam
from him spread like a mist through the wood, but still he stuck to his work. He
undercut another tree, but his back began to ache so that he could not stand. He
drove his axe into the tree and sat down to rest.
The imp, noticing that Iván had stopped work, grew cheerful.
'At last,' thought he, 'he is tired out! He will give it up. Now I can take a
rest myself.'

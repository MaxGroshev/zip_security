And really, on looking out of the window they saw an unusual bustle going on in the hut. Girls ran in and out, now for one thing and now for another.

“Will it soon be ready?” cried Belétski.

“Very soon! Why? Is Grandad hungry?” and from the hut came the sound of ringing laughter.

Ústenka, plump, small, rosy, and pretty, with her sleeves turned up, ran into Belétski’s hut to fetch some plates.

“Get away or I shall smash the plates!” she squeaked, escaping from Belétski. “You’d better come and help,” she shouted to Olénin, laughing. “And don’t forget to get some refreshments for the girls.” (“Refreshments” meaning spicebread and sweets.)

“And has Maryánka come?”

“Of course! She brought some dough.”

“Do you know,” said Belétski, “if one were to dress Ústenka up and clean and polish her up a bit, she’d be better than all our beauties. Have you ever seen that Cossack woman who married a colonel; she was charming! Bórsheva? What dignity! Where do they get it...”

“I have not seen Bórsheva, but I think nothing could be better than the costume they wear here.”

“Ah, I’m first-rate at fitting into any kind of life,” said Belétski with a sigh of pleasure. “I’ll go and see what they are up to.”

dropped out, and now it has all gone to pieces. We can remember nothing of it.
Teach us again.'
The Bishop crossed himself, and leaning over the ship's side, said:
'Your own prayer will reach the Lord, men of God. It is not for me to teach
you. Pray for us sinners.
And the Bishop bowed low before the old men; and they turned and went
back across the sea. And a light shone until daybreak on the spot where they
were lost to sight.

THE IMP AND THE CRUST
A POOR peasant set out early one morning to plough, taking with him for his
breakfast a crust of bread. He got his plough ready, wrapped the bread in his
coat, put it under a bush, and set to work. After a while when his horse was tired
and he was hungry, the peasant fixed the plough, let the horse loose to graze and
went to get his coat and his breakfast
He lifted the coat, but the bread was gone! He looked and looked, turned
the coat over, shook it out -- but the bread was gone. The peasant could not
make this out at all.

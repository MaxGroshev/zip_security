// Visibility rules aren't rigorously externally specified, but here
// are the basic principles behind what we implement:
//
// 1. An explicit visibility attribute is generally a direct expression
// of the user's intent and should be honored.  Only the innermost
// visibility attribute applies.  If no visibility attribute applies,
// global visibility settings are considered.
//
// 2. There is one caveat to the above: on or in a template pattern,
// an explicit visibility attribute is just a default rule, and
// visibility can be decreased by the visibility of template
// arguments.  But this, too, has an exception: an attribute on an
// explicit specialization or instantiation causes all the visibility
// restrictions of the template arguments to be ignored.
//
// 3. A variable that does not otherwise have explicit visibility can
// be restricted by the visibility of its type.
//
// 4. A visibility restriction is explicit if it comes from an
// attribute (or something like it), not a global visibility setting.
// When emitting a reference to an external symbol, visibility
// restrictions are ignored unless they are explicit.
//
// 5. When computing the visibility of a non-type, including a
// non-type member of a class, only non-type visibility restrictions
// are considered: the 'visibility' attribute, global value-visibility
// settings, and a few special cases like __private_extern.
//
// 6. When computing the visibility of a type, including a type member
// of a class, only type visibility restrictions are considered:
// the 'type_visibility' attribute and global type-visibility settings.
// However, a 'visibility' attribute counts as a 'type_visibility'
// attribute on any declaration that only has the former.
//
// The visibility of a "secondary" entity, like a template argument,
// is computed using the kind of that entity, not the kind of the
// primary entity for which we are computing visibility.  For example,
// the visibility of a specialization of either of these templates:
//   template <class T, bool (&compare)(T, X)> bool has_match(list<T>, X);
//   template <class T, bool (&compare)(T, X)> class matcher;
// is restricted according to the type visibility of the argument 'T',
// the type visibility of 'bool(&)(T,X)', and the value visibility of
// the argument function 'compare'.  That 'has_match' is a value
